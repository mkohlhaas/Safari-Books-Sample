			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"></a>Chapter 7</em>: The Three Ms</h1>
			<p>Through the previous chapters, you have learned how to program in Lua and create engaging Roblox games. With the skills you have, you can create a game around virtually any vision that comes to mind. However, it is one thing to create a game of your own, but to find success with it you need to follow a set of steps to optimize your game's performance.</p>
			<p>The main performance categories for a game typically rely on three alliterative factors, those being <strong class="bold">Mechanics</strong>, <strong class="bold">Monetization</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Marketing</strong>—or, as I have coined them, <strong class="bold">The Three Ms</strong>. This chapter will focus on introducing you to the best practices to follow regarding these three groups, to ensure that your game is as enjoyable as possible for players, your earnings are maximized without intruding on the user experience, and your game captures and retains the largest audience possible.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mechanics</li>
				<li>Monetization</li>
				<li>Marketing</li>
				<li>Reviewing what you've learned</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"></a>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>This chapter will focus entirely on the best practices to finding success on the Roblox platform. Some articles from the developer website and the <strong class="bold">Developer Forum</strong> (<strong class="bold">DevForum</strong>) will be linked throughout the chapter, so having an internet connection to view these or to research any other mentioned topic would be beneficial.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"></a>Mechanics</h1>
			<p>The first <em class="italic">M</em> we will cover is mechanics. The mechanics of games on Roblox, or <a id="_idIndexMarker442"></a>any platform for that matter, can vary widely. Some popular themes on Roblox include simulators, <strong class="bold">Roleplay</strong> (<strong class="bold">RP</strong>) games, tycoons, and minigames. The shared characteristic between these games regarding mechanics can be simplified down to repeated reward, social interaction, or both.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will break down the mechanics of these commonly occurring game themes and identify what makes them successful so that you can potentially integrate those ideas into entire genres of your own creation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"></a>Simulators</h2>
			<p>For games such as <a id="_idIndexMarker443"></a>simulators, users start off with very mediocre tools, weapons, or abilities. Over time, as users perform some simple task—often as <a id="_idIndexMarker444"></a>simple as clicking their mouse—they gain stats, which can be converted to a currency that is used to purchase better items in the game. This allows players at the beginning of the game to make progress more quickly. Of course, the ability to make progress <em class="italic">more quickly</em> is something of an illusion, as the price of items increases exponentially, forcing you to <em class="italic">grind</em>. The genius of this format is that it allows new players to progress rather rapidly while they are consistently being rewarded with what seems like great amounts of currency. As the requirements for reaching the next progress marker increase, players seek the easily attained success they were conditioned to when they began playing the game, encouraging them to continue playing.</p>
			<p>Have a look at the following screenshot:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1 – RussoPlays completes a beginning quest while showcasing Power Simulator in a video</p>
			<p>Despite capturing and often firmly holding an audience, simulators do not have an infinite lifespan. Without consistent updates audiences will become bored, especially if they have acquired all <a id="_idIndexMarker445"></a>unlockable content within the game. The trick to keeping a simulator <a id="_idIndexMarker446"></a>alive is to provide new content frequently at the beginning and then slowly less as you transition to other projects. With each update, you should add new unlockable items and other free content, as well as some new monetization options. A famous example of a long-lived game of <a id="_idIndexMarker447"></a>this genre is <strong class="bold">Bubble Gum Simulator</strong>, by <strong class="bold">Rumble Studios</strong>. It was released in 2018 and still receives tens of thousands of concurrent players every day; they have managed to do this by following the preceding steps.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"></a>RP games</h2>
			<p>RP games have <a id="_idIndexMarker448"></a>been on the Roblox platform for some time, but recently they have <a id="_idIndexMarker449"></a>begun to dominate the <strong class="bold">Popular</strong> sort, with new renditions of the concept. RP games should not be confused with <strong class="bold">role-playing games</strong> (<strong class="bold">RPGs</strong>), which are <a id="_idIndexMarker450"></a>typically quest-based games, which involve unlocking different items and discovering many places as you explore. RP games are games where users simply fulfill some role, typically in a peaceful setting. Some famous examples are games that take place in cities or neighborhoods and <a id="_idIndexMarker451"></a>that are focused <a id="_idIndexMarker452"></a>around doing fun tasks or becoming a <a id="_idIndexMarker453"></a>member of a family, such as <strong class="bold">Adopt Me</strong>, <strong class="bold">Meep City</strong>, <strong class="bold">RoCitizens</strong>, and more.</p>
			<p>These games are particularly successful because players can do many non-repetitive things and the game has no end. While there are often things to discover and explore, most of the game is oriented around interactions with other people and improving personal items, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker454"></a>raising pets or customizing your house. These games, as with <a id="_idIndexMarker455"></a>simulators, still need to be updated and, similarly, updates should include new free contents as well as new monetization choices.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"></a>Tycoons</h2>
			<p>In recent years, tycoons <a id="_idIndexMarker456"></a>in the traditional sense have become less <a id="_idIndexMarker457"></a>popular on the Roblox platform, but they still exist in a slightly different format compared to their original counterparts. Tycoons are games where players add different items—typically machines—to a home base in order to earn more currency. With more currency, players can in turn buy more decorative and functional objects for their base, expanding until they dominate the server. While not all tycoons revolve around combat, there is almost always some element that keeps players competing against each other outside of showing who the richest player on the server is. The following screenshot gives an example of a typical tycoon game:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer067" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/Figure_7.2_B16623.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2 – An example of a game of the traditional dropper tycoon genre, Miner's Haven
" width="548" height="310">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2 – An example of a game of the traditional dropper tycoon genre, Miner's Haven</p>
			<p>These games have fallen somewhat out of favor because once a tycoon is complete and all items are unlocked, there is not much of an incentive to continue playing. Updating these games <a id="_idIndexMarker458"></a>can be a more difficult task, depending on how your tycoon is structured. When updating, it is best <a id="_idIndexMarker459"></a>to add new items to your tycoon, new map features, and new additions to monetization. Inevitably, these games tend to lose their peak success after a comparatively shorter length of time than games of the other genres that have been mentioned.</p>
			<p>In modern renditions of tycoon games, developers will often take <a id="_idIndexMarker460"></a>advantage of <strong class="bold">non-player characters</strong> (<strong class="bold">NPCs</strong>), more <a id="_idIndexMarker461"></a>complex ways of unlocking new items, infinite expansion capabilities, and sometimes stunning visuals. A good example of this <em class="italic">modern</em> type of <a id="_idIndexMarker462"></a>tycoon would be <strong class="bold">My Restaurant</strong>, by <strong class="bold">BIG Games</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"></a>Minigames</h2>
			<p>Minigames or any <a id="_idIndexMarker463"></a>sort of round-based, arcade-styled game have been continuously popular on the platform but do not see the same magnitude of success as the aforementioned genres. These arcade games are easier to update as you can simply add new levels or maps. Additionally, as with RP games, these games are incredibly social, with many players making sure to specifically join their friends or making use of parties. </p>
			<p>If you wish to make a round-based game, ensure that the social aspect is the focus, with many monetization features that do not interfere with the user experience. To do this, you will learn how to approach good monetization strategies for this genre and many others in the following section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"></a>Monetization</h1>
			<p>The next <em class="italic">M</em> is monetization. Monetization is one of the most important aspects of development if <a id="_idIndexMarker464"></a>your primary goal is to make Roblox either a career or a profitable hobby. The first thing to realize is that there are great and terrible implementations of monetization. For example, all players, regardless of whether they buy anything in your game or not, can be positively or negatively impacted by your monetization strategy. We will start off with what <em class="italic">not</em> to do.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the most egregious offender that you will see players mention is "pay-to-win" monetization. In these instances, players that have the ability to spend money can purchase very powerful items, or anything that gives them a unique advantage over free players. Some game <a id="_idIndexMarker465"></a>companies such as <strong class="bold">Electronic Arts Inc.</strong> (<strong class="bold">EA</strong>) are notorious for this style of monetization and it has in the past stunted the initial—and later, overall— performance of some of their games, such as <strong class="bold">Star Wars: Battlefront II</strong>, which had <a id="_idIndexMarker466"></a>an overbearing <em class="italic">loot crate</em> system. When monetization is implemented like this, it often leads to ruining the experience for all but the players who purchased the premium items and, even then, it is no more enjoyable for them to play against others who have bought the same perks.</p>
			<p>Making game passes that give an advantage is still an acceptable occurrence, but the abilities of these items should be somewhere in the mid- to upper-mid-tier range. This is an especially important practice to observe if your game has any match-making systems based on skill, as new players can otherwise buy their way to the top instantly. </p>
			<p>After fallout with their player bases due to overbearing monetization strategies, game development companies big and small have responded by shifting their main purchasable items to content expansion or cosmetic options. Cosmetic options are perfect for avoiding the previously mentioned problems, as choosing to make the purchase is purely based on personal preference and no advantage is gained or lost by purchasing or not purchasing the item. </p>
			<p>For content expansion, this approach can also be implemented well, especially on Roblox. Normally, content expansion is accepted throughout various player communities but not to the extent that you must essentially purchase the game twice to unlock a full game experience. This error has also been made by triple-A game studios in the past, with detrimental effects to the game's performance. However, Roblox games are almost always free, outside of the few that choose to use the paid access system, which was mentioned back in <a href="B16623_02_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml.html#_idTextAnchor030"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Know Your Work Environment</em>. Because of Roblox being oriented around free-to-play games, having some content behind a paywall is even more acceptable than it would be elsewhere. A good application of this occurs in some simulators, where players can access an area that gives them <a id="_idIndexMarker467"></a>slightly more resources and cooler aesthetics only if they own a game pass; typically, something such as this would come with a VIP game pass. In review, both are viable strategies, and you should implement them as you see fit and monitor the response from your community.</p>
			<p>On the topic of a monetization option such as VIP, sometimes it can be more <a id="_idIndexMarker468"></a>advantageous to structure some paid benefits as a subscription as opposed to a single-purchase game pass. For example, let's say a VIP pass grants players in your game a special chat tag, a 1.5x boost for whatever stat, and access to a special location. Something such as this could be priced around 400 Robux for some games. However, data has shown that turning these benefits into a subscription, whereby players can purchase a product to add on to their remaining VIP time, can actually increase profits by a considerable margin over a similar time interval as compared to selling a game pass version. Currently, to make a subscription system, you need to record the times at which products are purchased and save that information to the player's data. This is not a very complicated process, but nor is it the most convenient. Because of this, Roblox has listened to its developers and plans to devise a new subscription <a id="_idIndexMarker469"></a>system and implement it into its <strong class="bold">application programming interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">API</strong>) so that developers do not need to do any of the backend themselves. At the time of writing, this system has not been released to developers in any form, but you can look up some potential future uses of it by visiting the developer website using the following link and searching for <strong class="sou ce-inline">subscription</strong> within the page: <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/MarketplaceService">https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/MarketplaceService</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"></a>Marketing</h1>
			<p>Finally, the last <em class="italic">M</em> is marketing. Marketing is the process throu<a id="_idTextAnchor141"></a>gh which you will <a id="_idIndexMarker470"></a>make your games known to the world and gain thousands of new players. We have touched on some marketing concepts before, but let's look at what makes a marketing campaign successful and how to engage the most players at a minimal cost.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"></a>Roblox promotion system</h2>
			<p>As previously <a id="_idIndexMarker471"></a>discussed, Roblox has an internal <a id="_idIndexMarker472"></a>system of promotion that utilizes two forms in which promotional material appears to players; these <a id="_idIndexMarker473"></a>are called <strong class="bold">User Ads</strong> and <strong class="bold">Sponsors</strong>. In <em class="italic">Figure 7.3</em>, you can see an example of a game promoted <a id="_idIndexMarker474"></a>via the <strong class="bold">Sponsors</strong> system and an advertisement made for a game using the <strong class="bold">User Ads</strong> system:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer068" class="IMG---Figure">

" width="519" height="444">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3 – This shows examples of the Sponsors (top) and User Ads (bottom) promotion systems</p>
			<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to using one of these systems over the other. When <a id="_idIndexMarker475"></a>using the <strong class="bold">Sponsors</strong> system, advertisement-blocking web browser extensions will not stop the promotional material from showing, as they do with User Ads. This can have a <a id="_idIndexMarker476"></a>big effect because, as of recently, the User Ads system stopped displaying contents on the <strong class="bold">Games</strong> page, and now ads can only be found in certain locations on the website.</p>
			<p>In the case of User Ads, you can create a custom image, matching specific dimensions, to advertise your game. This <a id="_idIndexMarker477"></a>can be especially beneficial if your game is not defined by a single image, such as the icon of your game, which is what is displayed when using the <strong class="bold">Sponsors</strong> system. Often, developers will make anything from renders, to memes, to full comic strips using this system, to give their game more character from a first glance compared to that achieved by a game icon using the <strong class="bold">Sponsors</strong> system.</p>
			<p>Toward the end of 2020, however, a change to the <strong class="bold">Games</strong> page was made that has severely affected the amount of impressions developers receive for the Robux they spend. Like the <strong class="bold">User Ads</strong> system having its display locations limited, a change in the order of sorts on the <strong class="bold">Games</strong> page has made it so that players will only see sponsored games if they scroll down to the <strong class="bold">Popular</strong> or <strong class="bold">Most Engaging</strong> sort, and any others further down. This has had some serious and immediate negative effects, with some developers seeing significant engagement with their promotional material lost since the change. This is unfortunately removing the traditional avenue through which developers made their games popular.</p>
			<p>Another factor negatively impacting <strong class="bold">discoverability</strong> (how users can find your game) that occurred toward the end of 2020 is Roblox blocking search engines from showing material from its website. The search tools on the Roblox website are notoriously inaccurate. Unless <a id="_idIndexMarker478"></a>the game you are searching for is very popular, the results returned are often completely <a id="_idIndexMarker479"></a>random, with the names of the games shown barely, if at all, correlating with your search terms. Because of this, many users turn to Google or Bing to search for games more quickly. The <strong class="bold">Developer Relations</strong> team <a id="_idIndexMarker480"></a>has indicated that this is a temporary change as they attempt to improve their website search tools. You can follow the status of this issue by monitoring the following linked DevForum thread and others like it: <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/no-roblox-games-show-up-in-google-search/841736/33">https://devforum.roblox.com/t/no-roblox-games-show-up-in-google-search/841736/33</a>.</p>
			<p>Roblox is, however, making some positive changes to improve the current state of discoverability. In 2020, it rolled out and intends to expand a new system that allows for promotional campaigns to be targeted at specific, but limited, demographics so that you can best capture your potential audience and your efforts are not spent on someone who is less likely to be interested in the content you create. You can learn more about this change in behavior by following this link to the DevForum: <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/we-ve-rebuilt-sponsored-games/832597">https://devforum.roblox.com/t/we-ve-rebuilt-sponsored-games/832597</a>.</p>
			<p>As an ending point of advice for this section, you should ask yourself where you want to distribute your marketing money in order to engage the most players. This really depends on how compatible your game is with different devices. In most cases, for your game to be the most enjoyable on mobile, tablet, and Xbox, you may need to make special cases for controls as well as more peripheral features, such as changing the appearance <a id="_idIndexMarker481"></a>of the <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>) on screens. With the new features just mentioned, you should also <a id="_idIndexMarker482"></a>decide which demographic <a id="_idIndexMarker483"></a>is most likely to enjoy your games, whether that be based on age, gender, or anything else.</p>
			<p>Moving forward, we will discuss an alternative form of promotion to reach much further than you would traditionally be able to with the Roblox promotion system, all the while avoiding the current setbacks it has.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"></a>YouTubers</h2>
			<p>Because of the previously <a id="_idIndexMarker484"></a>mentioned factors and some older trends on the Roblox <a id="_idIndexMarker485"></a>platform, YouTubers are becoming a major component of any marketing campaign. As mentioned in <a href="B16623_01_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml.html#_idTextAnchor016"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Welcome to Roblox Development</em>, the relationship between Roblox developers and YouTubers is symbiotic; as developers make games, it gives YouTubers content to film, and in turn, subscribers to that YouTuber often flock to the game that was featured.</p>
			<p>Outside of general exposure, sometimes YouTubers are in search of developers to create games for their audiences to play or so that they can host events. When opportunities such as these occur, you should take them. Not only do you promote yourself and your development abilities, but you also make strong connections with those influencers, who will likely be willing to make videos on games you make in the future. An example of this was my own partnership with <strong class="bold">Tofuu</strong>, whose channel is seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7.4</em>. Tofuu was <a id="_idIndexMarker486"></a>looking to create a game with a team of developers, and together we <a id="_idIndexMarker487"></a>created <strong class="bold">Munching Masters</strong>, my second most popular game to date, which has had more than 50 million visits.</p>
			<p>It should be clear that you do not need to make a full project with influencers to establish a connection with them. The biggest professional tip I could give in this book is to simply reach out. You will be surprised how often simply taking the initiative of reaching out to someone will return a positive response. Remember, the worst that can happen in any of these cases is that your offer is simply declined.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"></a>Reviewing what you've learned</h1>
			<p>With the conclusion of this chapter, you have completed this course in Roblox development. You have gone from having what is likely little to no experience working with Roblox to possessing the tools necessary to create your own career. Let's look at some of the skills you gained chronologically, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the first chapter, you learned about what the <strong class="bold">Roblox</strong> platform is about and what it has enabled others to accomplish, and what you can accomplish, through learning and practice. Additionally, we discussed the different types of developers that exist on the platform and the skillsets that each of them grants you, should you choose to take them up. Lastly, we talked about the professional skills to be gained that you can take into the future with you, regardless of your career trajectory. Overall, this chapter informed you why there is so much to be earned from the platform and what it has already done for others.</li>
				<li>In the second chapter, you learned about <strong class="bold">Roblox Studio</strong>, the beginning of the inner workings of Roblox development, and what it means to be a Roblox developer. Covering material about the Roblox website, the tools developers use to create their games' physical structure, as well as establishing general game and place settings, this chapter was critical for setting you on your path to succeed in the following chapters and in your career as a developer.</li>
				<li>The third chapter, was the most crucial part of this book for your future as a developer. This chapter covered numerous topics while introducing you to the <strong class="bold">Roblox Lua</strong> language; not only will learning Lua be key for creating games on Roblox, but it also provides an excellent base for any programming you do in the future. Moreover, you learned many universal constructs in programming and computing, including programming knowledge that can be applied to many languages, how your computer processes different datatypes, the client-server relationship, and much more. After introducing various datatypes, you learned how to manipulate them; in the case of <strong class="bold">CFrames</strong> and vectors, you developed the skills to work in 3D environments, an invaluable ability to learn early on should you enter a <strong class="bold">STEM</strong> field.</li>
				<li>The fourth chapter taught you more outside of general programming. To be specific, you learned how to manipulate the physical aspects of your game's environments, how to improve and add effects to different systems, and how developers create many game behaviors by way of Roblox services and APIs.</li>
				<li>Chapters 5 and 6 focused on creating games, using all of the knowledge you had learned up until then. These chapters expanded your skills by demonstrating how to accomplish behaviors that are common throughout many games so that you are best enabled to make whichever kind of game you envision in the future. For example, the way that the Obby and Battle Royale games are dynamically structured allows code, such as that contained within the <strong class="sou ce-inline">Datastore</strong> or <strong class="sou ce-inline">Monetization</strong> modules, to simply be added into future projects, with little to no time spent modifying them. Whenever you are in doubt, you will always be able to refer to these chapters to observe the skills in programming style, use of services, and overall game organization.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this final chapter, you learned the best practices to ensure that whatever concept or theme you create in the future, it has the best chance of finding an audience and becoming profitable and popular among players from around the world. By heeding the advice of the Three Ms (Mechanics, Monetization, and Marketing), I have no doubt that you will have games garnering thousands of concurrent users in no time. Remember that while we focused on the prospects of making money from what is otherwise a hobby, remember to have fun and experiment with what you want to do. Make your games how you want them to be because the wonderful thing about topics in development theory, such as those discussed in this chapter, is that they are constantly evolving. So, do not be afraid to get out there and invent a genre of your own design. Make concepts and visuals that no one has ever conceived before. Be the best developer you can be from your own perspective.</p>
			<p>Now, we find ourselves here, at the end. But in reality, this is not the end. For you, you have arrived at the bright beginning of making lifelong friends, memorable game titles, professional connections, and money to support yourself in the future. </p>
			<p>I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors!</p>
