			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>Chapter 2</em>: Knowing Your Work Environment</h1>
			<p>Fully knowing your work environment allows you, as a developer, to make progress on your projects more efficiently. Familiarizing yourself with the interfaces that Roblox developers work with on a daily basis in order to produce expansive, high-quality games will set you on a path to make your own. </p>
			<p>From this chapter, you will be able to create new <strong class="bold">places</strong> for games on your profile, change external game settings, learn how to navigate and use <strong class="bold">Roblox Studio</strong>, and make use of the additional resources Roblox offers. You will also be able to manipulate some of the smaller, yet convenient, features it provides.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Traversing the Create page</li>
				<li>Getting started with Roblox Studio</li>
				<li>Exploring plugins and the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"></a>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>For this chapter, you will need access to a computer that meets the requirements to run Roblox Studio. In order to utilize most of the features of Roblox Studio, you will also need a stable internet connection. More information on the system requirements of Roblox can be found here:</p>
			<p><a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312800">https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312800</a></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"></a>Traversing the Create page</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Create</strong> tab of the Roblox<a id="_idIndexMarker030"></a> website displays all of your created games and uploaded assets, showing the most recently created first, in the tab related to the asset's category. Additionally, many of the actions that can be taken to change different overall settings of your game can be completed here. To access the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page, navigate <a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a>to <a href="https://www.roblox.com/develop">https://www.roblox.com/develop</a>, and you will be brought to the page depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 2.1</em>:</p>

" width="639" height="706">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – The Create page shows everything related to development</p>
			<p>To continue with this chapter, you<a id="_idIndexMarker032"></a> need to navigate to the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> tab. Once there, find the default game that was created when your account was activated. If for some reason no games are shown in a list under the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> tab, click the <strong class="bold">Create New Game</strong> button, scroll down, and click <strong class="bold">Create Game</strong>. At this point, you can return to the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page and continue. Now you are set to learn how to configure the external settings of your game and make use of the other resources that the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page offers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"></a>Configuring Game and Place settings</h2>
			<p>Perhaps it has occurred to <a id="_idIndexMarker033"></a>you that there are certain settings you want to change for your game, such as how many players can fit into a server or even what platforms the game can be played on. For settings such as these, no programming is necessary; the changes can, and in most cases should, be done through different options that are accessible through the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page.</p>
			<p>Once you are under the <strong class="bold">Games</strong> section of the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page, which is selectable on the left side of your screen, click on the gear icon on the right side of your game, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em>. By clicking this icon, you will be presented with a drop-down menu that lists a variety of choices:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer011" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_02.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – A default view of a game's gear icon menu on the Roblox website
" width="429" height="333">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – A default view of a game's gear icon menu on the Roblox website</p>
			<p>For this section, however, the focus will be on the <strong class="bold">Configure Game</strong> and <strong class="bold">Configure Start Place</strong> options, as there is an abundance of important information to cover.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"></a>The Configure Game menu</h2>
			<p>By clicking <strong class="bold">Configure Game</strong>, you will be<a id="_idIndexMarker034"></a> able to change a number of aspects regarding your game. You will notice the ability to change your game between a <strong class="bold">Public</strong> and <strong class="bold">Private</strong> privacy status, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.3</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_03.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – The Configure Game menu is one page where external game settings are changed
" width="469" height="333">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – The Configure Game menu is one page where external game settings are changed</p>
			<p>Let's look at the difference between the <strong class="bold">Private</strong> and <strong class="bold">Public</strong> settings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When a game is set to <strong class="bold">Private</strong>, no players except yourself and those you manually set permissions for will be able to play your game.</li>
				<li>When a game is set to <strong class="bold">Public</strong>, all Roblox users will have the ability to play your game. We will discuss how to change these permissions for specific users once we get to the topic of Roblox Studio.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Both the <strong class="bold">Configure Game</strong> and <strong class="bold">Configure Start Place</strong> pages have a tab where dev products can be created and configured. While the process is straightforward enough to be self-explanatory, not that you can add a name, price, description, and image for your dev products. They will appear as you have configured them in all of your game servers, updating in real time. When we cover creating your own game, we will discuss how to link the purchase of both game passes and dev products to your scripts, in order to make them function properly.</p>
			<p>Further down the list of <a id="_idIndexMarker035"></a>tabs for the <strong class="bold">Configure Game</strong> page, Roblox allows you to place links to different social media accounts. This is the only place where you should include social media links, as Roblox dictates in its terms of service that it shows or hides certain social media links based on the age indicated by a user's account in order to protect younger players. As has been demonstrated by many unfortunate developers before, a violation of this clause may lead to moderation action against your account or game.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"></a>Configuring Start Place menu</h2>
			<p>Now, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker036"></a>navigate to <strong class="bold">Configure Start Place</strong>, you will find many more options that are relevant to the appearance and settings of your game as a whole; some of these settings are visible in <em class="italic">Figure 2.4</em>. You are immediately presented with the <strong class="bold">Basic Settings</strong> tab, which allows you to change the name of your game and the description that is shown beneath it:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer013" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_04.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – The Configure Place page is like the Configure Game page but has different settings
" width="743" height="476">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – The Configure Place page is like the Configure Game page but has different settings</p>
			<p>The second tab, titled <strong class="bold">Game Icon</strong>, allows you to change the <strong class="bold">icon</strong> of your game. An icon is a square image that typically serves as the first impression players have of your game when seeing it on the game's page or on a profile. Similarly, the <strong class="bold">Thumbnails</strong> tab allows you to upload images that<a id="_idIndexMarker037"></a> represent your game and serve as the second and final impression before a user clicks the play button of your game. For 500 Robux, you can also upload a video up to 30 seconds in length; this feature allows you to show your game in action, which is often more engaging to potential players.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Access</strong> tab allows you to change different options for who can play your game. You will first see a list of checkboxes for the different platforms your game is available to play on. When we get to creating your first game, you will see that you should enable or disable these options based on the mechanics of your game and overall cross-platform compatibility for controls. Below these boxes, you will see an option to sell access to your game. While most games are free to play on Roblox, you can make access to your game a point of monetization (but in most cases, this will lower the number of people who play your game).</p>
			<p>The next setting, <strong class="bold">Maximum Player Count</strong>, should be changed based on how many players should realistically be able to play your game on one server. While the decision for this value is up to you, remember to consider the performance limitations of your game as well as how its various mechanics may be affected if there are too many or too few players available. A setting that is <a id="_idIndexMarker038"></a>very closely related to the maximum player count is how Roblox decides to fill servers with players. By default, the <strong class="bold">Roblox optimizes server fill for me</strong> option is selected, and it is typically best to leave it as such. It may, in some situations, make more sense to reserve a few server slots if you find your game benefits greatly from players having their friends join them, but as a beginner, there is no reason to change this setting.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Access</strong> setting has the option of <strong class="bold">Everyone</strong> or <strong class="bold">Friends</strong>/<strong class="bold">Group</strong> Members, depending on whether the game is being hosted on a player's profile or on a group. You may change this setting at your own discretion, but as usual, if your game has restrictions regarding who can play, then your player count will be limited by that factor.</p>
			<p>The last setting of the <strong class="bold">Access</strong> tab allows <a id="_idIndexMarker039"></a>you to enable the sale of <strong class="bold">private servers</strong> (formerly called VIP servers). Private servers are a monthly subscription purchased by players so that they can play uninterrupted, only with friends, or only with those that they invite. Since private servers are a recurring purchase, they can continue to generate passive income even after a game declines in popularity. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">In order to sell access to your game, you cannot simultaneously sell private servers. When selling access to your game, the minimum price for access is 25 Robux and the maximum access price is 1,000 Robux. When selling private servers, the minimum price is 10 Robux if you do not want to have them be free. There is currently no limit to the maximum price of private servers.</p>
			<p>While there are some other tabs of the two different settings pages that were not covered in this section, most of them have been deprecated or are a setting that you typically would not need to interact with under normal circumstances. Once you become a more experienced developer and you find that you need to change those options, you will know how to.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"></a>Other Place options</h2>
			<p>Returning to the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page, there were many more options on the gear drop-down menu previously shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em>; you <a id="_idIndexMarker040"></a>should be familiar with these before creating your first game. While some of these topics will not be covered in depth, you should know what they are in order to have an advantage when you begin developing more intricate projects.</p>
			<p>Immediately following the <strong class="bold">Configure Game</strong> and <strong class="bold">Configure Start Place</strong> options, you will see a <strong class="bold">Configure Localization</strong> option. This page acts as a portal for your game to be manually translated into various supported languages. From here, you can add different Roblox users or groups to translate your game, add or remove languages you want your game to be supported in, and see what text entries from your game have already been recorded and translated. Roblox also announced in mid-2020 that they have begun rolling out automatic translation for both game web pages and in-game sources to the top games on the platform, with plans to expand this to more games after a trial period. For more information on configuring localization, see the primary article on Roblox localization here: <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Introduction-to-Localization-on-Roblox">https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Introduction-to-Localization-on-Roblox</a>.</p>
			<p>The next option on the menu is <strong class="bold">Create Badge</strong>. <strong class="bold">Badges</strong> are items that are awarded to players and show up on their profile. Once <a id="_idIndexMarker041"></a>awarded, a badge cannot be given again unless the player deletes it from their inventory. While badges are mostly used for display or novelty purposes, they are sometimes used as somewhat of a hacky way to track different data types. For example, if you want all players who tested your game pre-release to receive something special later on, the most convenient way to do that is to simply award them a badge. With this technique, even though datastores will be reset when the game releases, you can still identify whether a player is in possession of that badge and subsequently award them for being an early supporter of your project.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Create Game Pass</strong> selection will bring you to a different tab of the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page. Like dev products, you can add a name, description, and image to your game pass with the interface depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 2.5</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer014" class="IMG---Figure">

" width="351" height="230">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – The interface for creating game passes shown is similar to that of dev products</p>
			<p>Once created, your game pass will be listed, and clicking the gear icon next to it will allow you to configure the price of the game pass, whether it is on sale, and the aforementioned settings.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Add Gear</strong> option is an<a id="_idIndexMarker042"></a> arguably antiquated system of selling different types of Roblox-made power-ups in your game. Most games do not utilize <strong class="bold">gears</strong> much at all in the modern age of the platform, but perhaps it may be in your interest to sell some of these items. If you wish to do so, it is best to create a game pass for your gear as Roblox will only give you a 10 percent commission for selling theirs in contrast to 70 percent for selling your own. You can acquire these power-up items by searching for them, by name, through a collection of free assets that we will cover in the next section.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Developer Stats</strong> tab will become quite important once you begin monitoring the performance of your own games. The page this button brings you to is the center for all of your game analytics. From here, you can see the average engagement time of a player, the total amount earned from in-game sales before tax, and how many users are playing on which platforms, all viewable as datasets over different time intervals. In addition, you can export the analytics of your game as a CSV or XLSX file for a further breakdown of your data in your desired external application.</p>
			<p>In order to have your game reach players, Roblox has two built-in types of promotion, called <strong class="bold">User Ads</strong> and <strong class="bold">Sponsored Games</strong>. Promoting your game through this system costs Robux and the more you bid, the more impressions on players your promotion will have (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.6</em>). You have the choice for which platforms your campaign runs on, meaning if your game is not available to play on Xbox, you needn't waste money by showing promotional information to Xbox players:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_06.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – The more Robux you bid, the more estimated impressions you will receive
" width="629" height="386">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – The more Robux you bid, the more estimated impressions you will receive</p>
			<p>The difference between advertising and sponsoring a game is simply how your promotional material will physically appear to potential players. For example, when using the <strong class="bold">Sponsored Games</strong> system, the icon of your game will show wherever a list of games is present, including the front page or when a player searches for games with the search bar. Underneath your icon, the words <strong class="bold">Sponsored Ad</strong> will be displayed. When using the <strong class="bold">User Ads</strong> system, you must upload an image of a certain size from a list of pre-set dimensions. While<a id="_idIndexMarker043"></a> sometimes ads yield a higher <strong class="bold">Click-Through Rate</strong> (<strong class="bold">CTR</strong>) (clicks divided by impressions), they are less often displayed to players. The reason for this is because most ad-blocking plugins for web browsers automatically hide them and, by default, ads are <a id="_idIndexMarker044"></a>no longer shown on the front page. I personally use the <strong class="bold">Sponsored</strong> system, though it is a current debate within the developer community which system is better. Effectiveness will ultimately result from how engaging the design of your icon or advertisement image is.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">You may find it valuable to know that the number of impressions you receive scales linearly with how much you bid, meaning that if you were to bid twice as much, you would receive approximately two times as many impressions. How many impressions you receive from a promotion will vary daily based on how many other developers are promoting their games. For additional <a id="_idIndexMarker045"></a>information on the <strong class="bold">User Ads</strong> system specifically, visit this page: https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Advertising.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37">The Library and Ava<a id="_idTextAnchor037"></a>tar Shop</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Library</strong> is a collection of<a id="_idIndexMarker046"></a> game assets created by other users. Better known as the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong> when using it directly from Studio, developers can find a wide array of free scripts, audio, models, images, meshes, and plugins that can be utilized in their games for free, without attribution. While it is an excellent resource that should be taken advantage of, there are some things to keep in mind when using it. Firstly, make sure that you are not overusing free models. While there is truly no shame in doing so, many members of the development community often look down on the overuse of them, as your projects consist less and less of your own work. Additionally, while most models are completely safe to use, some malicious users take pride in placing scripts in these models that can cause lag or unexpected behavior in your game. This vulnerability does not exist when searching under the image, audio, or mesh categories, as scripts cannot be added to these assets in the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong>. There is also little to no stigma surrounding the use of these types of assets as they are not necessarily as visible. The best advice is to use free models in moderation: look to see whether they are positively rated, and search through them for undesired scripts before use. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">As a note of caution, if you decide to upload your own assets to the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong>, make sure that they are appropriate and abide by the moderation guidelines. Uploading inappropriate or, in some cases, copyrighted assets can lead to a moderation action against your account. This could range from deletion of the asset to a ban from the website, depending on the severity of your offense.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Avatar Shop</strong>, formerly and more commonly called the <strong class="bold">Catalog</strong>, is a collection of clothing and accessories for Roblox characters. Most accessories are made by Roblox, but some are made by reputable members of the community that have been admitted to the <strong class="bold">UGC Program</strong>, <strong class="bold">UGC</strong> standing for <strong class="bold">User-Generated Content</strong>. Clothing is free<a id="_idIndexMarker047"></a> to upload and can be made by anyone. These<a id="_idIndexMarker048"></a> clothing items and accessories can be used for free in your games either as part of character design or, in some cases, map additions.</p>
			<p>You can now completely <a id="_idIndexMarker049"></a>utilize the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page in order to make games of your own. Some important skills you have learned are how to create new games and fully configuring their external settings, promoting your games so that they can be found by more players, and taking advantage of free assets to ease your development process. These will all contribute to your ability to efficiently make a successful project as you learn how to use Roblox Studio in the following sections and begin programming in the following chapters. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"></a>Getting Started with Roblox studio</h1>
			<p>Roblox Studio is the <a id="_idIndexMarker050"></a>application in which you will create all of your games. With a variety of tools, information, and add-ons, Studio will function as your development hub from the conception of a project to its release.</p>
			<p>Return to the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page and click the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> button next to the gear icon. If Studio is not already downloaded, you will be prompted with a set of instructions to download it, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2.7</em>, the program will launch automatically after installing:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer016" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_07.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – Clicking the Edit button will prompt you to download Studio if it is not installed
" width="1646" height="894">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – Clicking the Edit button will prompt you to download Studio if it is not installed</p>
			<p>By the end of this section, you will know<a id="_idIndexMarker051"></a> how to navigate through the tabs and menus of Roblox Studio, be knowledgeable about the various tools within Studio, and be ready to begin setting up your first game.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"></a>The File menu and settings</h2>
			<p>Like most applications, the <strong class="bold">File</strong> menu holds a <a id="_idIndexMarker052"></a>variety of actions and submenus that are a core component of your use of the application; some of these are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.8</em>. While not all of these may be relevant to a beginner developer, there are some that are necessary for everyday Studio interactions:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_08.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – Clicking the Edit button will prompt you to download Studio if it is not installed
" width="231" height="338">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Clicking the Edit button will prompt you to download Studio if it is not installed</p>
			<p>Starting from the top<a id="_idIndexMarker053"></a> of the list, the <strong class="bold">New</strong> option simply opens a new Studio window with only a baseplate inside of the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>. Comparably, the <strong class="bold">Open from File…</strong> and <strong class="bold">Open from Roblox…</strong> options will open a new Studio session and prompt you to select an existing place accordingly. The <strong class="bold">Close File</strong> option will not close the window but instead bring you to a similar page as the <strong class="bold">Open from Roblox…</strong> action, which shows you a list of your created games.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Save to File</strong> and <strong class="bold">Save to File As…</strong> selections are<a id="_idIndexMarker054"></a> used when you want to create or update a place file. Place files use the <strong class="sou ce-inline">.rbxl</strong> extension; these files are usually quite small and can be easily transferred. Something to remember that will be covered further later is that some assets, such as images, that are uploaded directly to the game will not be visible when the file is open somewhere other than that game as they are indexed with a game-specific path. The <strong class="bold">Save to Roblox</strong> and <strong class="bold">Save to Roblox As…</strong> actions function similarly but will save your game to Roblox's servers.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Publish to Roblox</strong> and <strong class="bold">Publish to Roblox As…</strong> are a critical part of updating your game. As you make edits to your game, you will often notice autosaves, but they will not be pushed to affect new servers; instead, you must <strong class="bold">publish</strong> your game to Roblox. Something to remember is that when you successfully publish the current version of your game, it will not affect live servers that are already running. Instead, you must shut down all of the servers of your game or gradually migrate them to the current version. You can shut down the servers of your<a id="_idIndexMarker055"></a> game by navigating to its web page and clicking <strong class="bold">Shut Down All Servers</strong>, from the menu depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 2.9</em>. This menu can be found on the web page of your game by clicking the three dots at the top right:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_09.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – The three dots to toggle this menu are visible on all games you can edit
" width="233" height="354">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – The three dots to toggle this menu are visible on all games you can edit</p>
			<p>It is important that you <a id="_idIndexMarker056"></a>know that players will be kicked out of your game and forced to rejoin when using this option. The <strong class="bold">Migrate To Latest Update</strong> alternative also kicks out players but minimizes player rejoin times and overall disruption by creating new servers while shutting down old ones over a 6-minute interval rather than all at once. This is the optimal action for updating if you are not publishing a hot-fix or anything else that does not need to be immediately available to players.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Online Help</strong> button will bring you to the Roblox website, intended to aid developers. This website shows not only tutorials but also an abundance of documentation and other assistive assets that we will cover later on in this chapter. </p>
			<p>By clicking the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> button, a new dialog box will appear within Studio. There are many settings, some of which are <a id="_idIndexMarker057"></a>quite specific and advanced. Most of the options here do not need to be manipulated by a beginner except for some settings that <a id="_idIndexMarker058"></a>you may simply want to change for the sake of convenience; those settings, which are mostly cosmetic, will be explained in the following sections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"></a>Movement and camera manipulation</h2>
			<p>Manipulation of your<a id="_idIndexMarker059"></a> camera in Roblox Studio is quite simple. Your camera<a id="_idIndexMarker060"></a> will move relative to the direc<a id="_idTextAnchor041"></a>tion you are facing:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <em class="italic">W</em> key will always move your camera forward.</li>
				<li>The <em class="italic">A</em> key will move your camera left.</li>
				<li>The <em class="italic">S</em> key will move your camera back.</li>
				<li>The <em class="italic">D</em> key will move your camera right.</li>
				<li>The <em class="italic">E</em> key will move your camera up.</li>
				<li>The <em class="italic">Q</em> key will move your camera down.</li>
				<li>Additionally, holding the <em class="italic">Shift</em> key while moving your camera will cause movement to occur at a slower rate, which is convenient for examining smaller objects in the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In order to change the direction your camera is facing, hold down the right button of your mouse and move it. Using your scroll wheel, you can increment your camera by a set amount. By default, the scroll wheel will move your camera in the direction of your mouse, but this can be changed to simply increment toward or away from the direction your camera is facing by unchecking the <strong class="bold">Camera Zoom to Mouse Position</strong> setting in Studio.</p>
			<p>If you are not satisfied with your current camera speed, it can be altered by navigating to the <strong class="bold">Studio</strong> tab of the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> dialog box and changing the related values under the <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> section, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.10</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer019" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_10.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – Cosmetic settings for Studio can be found under the Studio tab of the settings menu
" width="503" height="400">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – Cosmetic settings for Studio can be found under the Studio tab of the settings menu</p>
			<p>While it depends on the <a id="_idIndexMarker061"></a>performance of your system, you may also want to increase<a id="_idIndexMarker062"></a> the graphics settings of Studio. To do this, navigate to the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> dialog box and access the <strong class="bold">Rendering</strong> tab. At the top of the <strong class="bold">Rendering</strong> tab, the <strong class="bold">Quality Level</strong> and <strong class="bold">Edit Quality Level</strong> settings will be set to <strong class="bold">Automatic</strong> by default. It is recommended that you change these values to <strong class="bold">Level 21</strong>, where all the details of the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> will be visible.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"></a>Utilizing the Explorer</h2>
			<p>By navigating to the <strong class="bold">Home</strong> tab of Studio and clicking the <strong class="bold">Part</strong> button, you will see the part appear in front of<a id="_idIndexMarker063"></a> you. By selecting the part and pressing the <em class="italic">F</em> key, your camera will focus on the part; this works for any selectable object. On the top-right side of the default Studi<a id="_idTextAnchor043"></a>o screen, you will see the <strong class="bold">Explorer</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Explorer</strong> serves as an interface that allows you to see all of the objects, more commonly called <strong class="bold">instances</strong>, within your game. We <a id="_idIndexMarker064"></a>will cover instances and other objects that show up in the <strong class="bold">Explorer</strong> in much more depth in the following chapters. For now, you will see the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> option at the top of the <strong class="bold">Explorer</strong>; it will be depicted by a globe, as highlighted in <em class="italic">Figure 2.11</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer020" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_11.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – This image shows the Explorer and Properties menus with Workspace selected

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – This image shows the Explorer and Properties menus with Workspace selected</p>
			<p>After selecting the part, you can see that there<a id="_idIndexMarker065"></a> are now many settings that are shown for it under the <strong class="bold">Properties</strong> menu. Properties of instances control how they behave or appear to your players. For parts, <strong class="bold">Anchored</strong>, <strong class="bold">CanCollide</strong>, <strong class="bold">Transparency</strong>, <strong class="bold">Material</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Color</strong> are some of the most commonly changed properties, and they can be seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2.12</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_12.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – Here, the Properties menu shows the discussed properties of the Part instance
" width="467" height="863">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12 – Here, the Properties menu shows the discussed properties of the <strong class="bold">Part</strong> instance</p>
			<p>Let's look at those five features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When a part is <a id="_idIndexMarker066"></a>set to <strong class="bold">Anchored</strong>, it cannot be moved by gravity or any other physics-related forces; a part with a false anchored property is called unanchored.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">CanCollide</strong> property determines whether a part can collide with any other instance in the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>. When disabled, the part will fall through the map until it is destroyed. Because of this, you will want your part anchored if this setting is enabled.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Transparency</strong> setting allows you to change how visible a part is and has a range of <strong class="sou ce-inline">0</strong> to <strong class="sou ce-inline">1</strong>. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Material</strong> is a list of different textures for parts that also have different visual and physical properties, including reflectivity, density, elasticity, and friction, though these can be changed via the <strong class="sou ce-inline">CustomPhysicalProperties</strong> property.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Color</strong> setting simply allows parts to have their color changed; RGB and HSV values are supported. Roblox<a id="_idIndexMarker067"></a> also includes a menu of titled, preset colors under the <strong class="bold">BrickColor</strong> property.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong class="sou ce-inline">Model</strong> is another type of instance, one that has the primary use of grouping different instances together. By holding the <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> key, you can select multiple parts either through the <strong class="bold">Explorer</strong> or by clicking on them in the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>. After selecting multiple parts, you can press <em class="italic">Ctrl + G</em> to do a group action, parenting all of the selected instances into a new model. This is convenient for organization as well as for use with some tools, which will be explained in the following section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"></a>Using Studio tools</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Select</strong> tool works simply as<a id="_idIndexMarker068"></a> a dragger for items in the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>; clicking down on an instance in the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> and moving your mouse will cause that object to go to wherever your mouse hits. One option you should disable when working with anchored parts is <strong class="bold">Join Surfaces</strong>, as it creates additional, unneeded instances in whatever is being dragged. This feature can be useful when working with unanchored parts, though, as it will connect them together while still being able to be affected by physical forces. The button for this can be found to the right of the four tools under either the <strong class="bold">Model</strong> or <strong class="bold">Home</strong> tabs.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Move</strong> tool shows six handles through which to move the selected object. These handles are pointed in relative directional vectors by default: those being the front, back, top, bottom, left, and right. Clicking down on these handles and dragging along the chosen axis will allow precise movements along said axis without changing position on the others. Some of the less obvious features you may want to be aware of when using this tool are the world coordinate toggle, the <strong class="bold">Snap to Grid</strong> setting, and the <strong class="bold">Collisions</strong> setting. By pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl + L</em>, the handles will point in global directions, instead of those relative to the instance. This feature is particularly important when an object is rotated, and you want the <strong class="bold">Move</strong> tool to behave as if it were not. The <strong class="bold">Collisions</strong> setting is on by default and prevents you from moving objects through one another. While this may be convenient in some circumstances, you will most likely want to have this option disabled, as it prevents you from moving parts when even the slightest collision with another part occurs. The <strong class="bold">Snap to Grid</strong> setting is under the <strong class="bold">Model</strong> tab and allows incremented control over the movement of your part. You can keep this on if you would like, but many developers tend to have this set to <strong class="sou ce-inline">0</strong> studs in order to have free movement over parts and models in the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> tool allows you to scale<a id="_idIndexMarker069"></a> both models and parts in size. Much like the <strong class="bold">Move</strong> tool, you can utilize the <strong class="bold">Snap to Grid</strong> feature when scaling instances. The handles for the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> tool will always be relative, so the world coordinate toggle will have no effect. Two additions to the scale tool are the <strong class="bold">mirrored scale</strong> and <strong class="bold">whole scale</strong> behaviors. By holding the <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> key while scaling a part, the scale action will be mirrored along the other side of the selected axis. Moreover, while models always scale as a whole, meaning they maintain their relative dimensions, you can scale a single instance with the same behavior by holding the <em class="italic">Shift</em> key while scaling.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Rotate</strong> tool also has six handles, which allow you to rotate an object around the <em class="italic">x</em>, <em class="italic">y</em>, and <em class="italic">z</em> axes. The <strong class="bold">Rotate</strong> tool takes advantage of both the world coordinate toggle as well as the <strong class="bold">Snap to Grid</strong> option. The <strong class="bold">Snap to Grid</strong> option input box for the <strong class="bold">Rotate</strong> tool is located above the one used for the <strong class="bold">Scale</strong> and <strong class="bold">Move</strong> tools and takes the desired change in degrees as opposed to change in <strong class="bold">Studs</strong>. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> tool serves as a combination of the aforementioned four and is located under the <strong class="bold">Model</strong> tab. It may be used at your preference and does have some advantages, including the ability to freely utilize the functionality of all four tools without being required to switch between them. Conveniently, the tool provides you with a grid along the bottom of the selected instance to guide you.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"></a>Managing the Game Settings menu</h2>
			<p>So far, you have learned how to<a id="_idIndexMarker070"></a> change many settings for your game through the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page, but Roblox includes some game options that can only be changed in Studio. The function of the <strong class="bold">Game Settings</strong> menu is similar to the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page but exists primarily to show additional settings and to provide convenient access for previously mentioned ones. <em class="italic">Figure 2.13</em> shows the appearance of the <strong class="bold">Game Settings</strong> menu and its tabs:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure">

" width="920" height="653">
				</div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13 – The Game Settings menu allows you to change settings on the Create page and more</p>
			<p>One of the newly rolled out Studio features is the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> tab of the menu. Previously, if you wanted to<a id="_idIndexMarker071"></a> have a select few people test your game, they would have to be ranked as a developer, or your testers would have to be the only members in a group and your game restricted to only be playable by group members. With the introduction of this feature, you can alter permissions for different users or group roles to play or edit your game. By granting the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> permission to a user or role, you can take <a id="_idIndexMarker072"></a>advantage of the <strong class="bold">Team Create</strong> feature, which will be covered in the following section.</p>
			<p>The options and presets visible under the <strong class="bold">Avatar</strong> tab used to be located under the <strong class="bold">Configure Game</strong> menu of the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page but were relocated for ease of access and due to the fact that they have more direct relevance to Studio. As you will see here and in some of the following tabs, you can leave most of the settings alone as the Roblox default values will likely suit most of your creations. However, if you are not familiar with it, Roblox has two main character types: <strong class="bold">R15</strong> and <strong class="bold">R6</strong>, with the number in each name signifying how many parts make up the character model. You will find, when programming, that you may want to index a body part that only exists in one of these rigs, such as a hand, for example. In order to limit how many additional cases you must create, you can force which rig type is used in your game in addition to some scaling and animation choices. While most<a id="_idIndexMarker073"></a> of the behaviors accomplished by these settings can be done by your own programs, it is best, in most situations, to use this menu for the sake of ease.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Options</strong> menu provides you with the ability to enable <strong class="bold">Collaborative Editing</strong>. This feature has also only recently been made available and serves mostly as a form of source control and is quite convenient when multiple programmers are working at once. When editing a script with this option enabled in <strong class="bold">Team Create</strong>, a <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong> button will appear under the <strong class="bold">View</strong> tab. Alterations made will only occur locally until the script has been committed; if edits to the program have already been made, you can observe the differences and merge before committing. While this feature does not contain some of the desired aspects of source control that something like <strong class="bold">Git</strong> offers, it can be used similarly with no additional setup.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Security</strong> tab is a crucial part of developing a new game with programmed systems. For example, if you wish for your game to be able to communicate with remote servers or allow Roblox datastores to save data while you are in Studio, those options will need to be enabled in this menu. The two other settings you will see are third-party sales and third-party teleports. If you program your games with even the most minimal security, which you will be taught to do in the programming chapters of this book, you can have these settings enabled as they may be of use in some future scenarios. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">World</strong> tab of the menu allows you to change various settings regarding how a player interacts with the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>, specifically in relation to physics and the different properties of a player's character. While this tab may be convenient for some changes, all of the settings here can be done through scripts or by changing the properties of different <strong class="bold">services</strong>, which will be explained once you begin programming. An example of changing these settings yourself would be to change the properties of a character's <strong class="bold">Humanoid</strong> instance or to simply change the <strong class="bold">Gravity</strong> property of the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> to allow players to jump higher. As a programmer, you should ensure that you know how to make these modifications without the menu, but for quick adjustments, it ultimately comes down to a matter of preference and convenience.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">In 2020, Roblox announced that they intend to transition all functionality of the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page to a new creator dashboard in Studio. While<a id="_idIndexMarker074"></a> not much information is available at the time of writing, it is likely that the interface will be similar to the current <strong class="bold">Game Settings</strong> menu.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"></a>The View tab</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">View</strong> tab of Studio presents <a id="_idIndexMarker075"></a>you with many additional tools as well as toggles for different information that can be displayed when developing. Some of these options are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.14</em>. Like the other concepts introduced in this chapter, you should familiarize yourself with these resources so that you are knowledgeable about them as you develop your skillset:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_14.jpg" alt="Figure 2.14 – The View tab allows developers to use additional tools and see hidden information.
" width="872" height="124">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14 – The View tab allows developers to use additional tools and see hidden information.</p>
			<p>One of the most crucial Studio tools for managing uploaded assets is the <strong class="bold">Game Explorer</strong> window. From this window, you can not only view all the assets that have been uploaded directly to the game, but you can also use the <strong class="bold">Bulk Import</strong> feature. The advantage of using the <strong class="bold">Bulk Import</strong> feature is that you can upload up to 50 assets at once to your game, as opposed to individually uploading them to the website. Something to be aware of, specifically in the case of images, is that when the asset is uploaded, the instance containing it cannot be directly transferred to a different game as the path defining the image is game-specific. You can find the asset URL by utilizing the manager, which will allow the asset to be used and viewable anywhere.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Team Create</strong> feature will bring up a side window within Studio, a core element of collaboration on projects. <strong class="bold">Team Create</strong> allows a project to be edited simultaneously by multiple developers, removing the issue of overwriting the changes made by other developers in different Studio sessions. In order to grant other users permission to edit your game, you will need to navigate to the <strong class="bold">Game Settings</strong> page and navigate to the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> tab. From there, you can look up users by name and ensure that the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> option is selected for them.</p>
			<p>While this will be covered more extensively once you begin learning how to program in Lua, the command bar serves as a spot for directly executing Lua code and it can be used when testing or simply in Studio. <strong class="bold">Command Bar</strong> will come to be a precious tool for completing tasks that <a id="_idIndexMarker076"></a>would be quite time-consuming, such as managing hundreds of assets or manipulating data.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Output</strong> window is almost always used alongside <strong class="bold">Command Bar</strong> and while conducting tests, as all output and executed code from the command bar is displayed there. More importantly, when a script in your game produces an error or any other output, it will be directed to this window. The errors, warnings, or prints will also be clickable in this window and bring you to the script and line that produced the output for easy debugging. If Studio needs to display additional information, such as the status of an action or that a player in <strong class="bold">Team Create</strong> completed a major action, that information will also be visible in the <strong class="bold">Output</strong> menu.</p>
			<p>Much like pressing <em class="italic">Shift + F5</em> shows framerate in-game (not in Studio) and additional rendering information, toggling the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> option under the <strong class="bold">View</strong> tab shows you framerate while in Studio as well as the rendering information that is normally available while playing a game.</p>
			<p>While Roblox Studio does provide you with many exciting features and tools, the program may freeze or crash when manipulating many objects at once, even in the 64-bit version. However, when this occurs, Roblox virtually always locally saves a file of the game on your computer. Furthermore, if you were only to crash in a <strong class="bold">Team Create</strong> environment, for example, you could use the <strong class="bold">Script Recovery</strong> tab to retrieve your lost progress and apply it to the current version of the game.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"></a>The Test tab</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Test</strong> tab of Studio presents you with<a id="_idIndexMarker077"></a> several different modes with which to test the functionality of your game. Before releasing a game, you should ensure that there are no errors or unwanted behaviors. In addition to making sure all of the systems of your game are working, make sure that your game functions correctly across the desired platforms you want it to be available on. The more platforms you have enabled for your game, the more potential players will be able to engage with your work. To start testing, there are a few initialization modes that can be seen by clicking the drop-down menu below the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button, as depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 2.15</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer024" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_15.jpg" alt="Figure 2.15 – There are three different initialization modes for testing
" width="128" height="136">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.15 – There are three different initialization modes for testing</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong class="bold">Play</strong> has a couple of behaviors <a id="_idIndexMarker078"></a>based on how the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> is configured. If there are <strong class="bold">Team</strong> instances parented to the <strong class="bold">Team</strong> section of the <strong class="bold">Explorer</strong> and a corresponding <strong class="bold">Spawn Location</strong> instance in the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>, then the player will spawn randomly at one of the team's spawn locations. If there are no team spawn locations or no teams, the player will spawn at a neutral spawn location, if one exists. If there are none, then players will spawn around the origin of the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>, that being position <em class="italic">0</em>, <em class="italic">0</em>, <em class="italic">0</em>.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Play Here</strong> option spawns you where your camera is positioned regardless of whether spawn locations or teams are present. If you have a script that manually sets the position of a character, this will have precedence as the testing mode positions players before a client loads in. </p>
			<p>Both the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> and <strong class="bold">Play Here</strong> options load you in as a client, meaning both local and server scripts will load, and you will have a command bar that can only make local changes. However, by clicking the <strong class="bold">Current</strong> button, which is under the <strong class="bold">Test</strong> tab, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2.16</em>, you can switch between client and server views, allowing you to utilize the server command bar and also a freely moveable camera. As an additional note, by pressing <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">P</em> when in client view or in-game, you can switch between a standard and free camera:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">

" width="232" height="94">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16 – The Pause, Resume, Stop, and Current buttons are only available when testing</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Run</strong> option will only run your game on the server. No clients will be created and you will only have access to the server command bar and see the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> strictly from the server view. You will not be able to use the <strong class="bold">Current</strong> view feature when in this mode. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Local Server</strong> is a way of<a id="_idIndexMarker079"></a> testing your game with multiple users if you do not have someone to test with. Each client (player) you create has a window where you can control it individually and with each test, there is one window that grants you a view from the perspective of the server. You can change how many clients are created using the drop-down menu below the <strong class="bold">Test type</strong> button; the range for this option is 0 to 8 clients. We will cover more about the client-server relationship in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Team Test</strong> option lets you and those with <strong class="bold">Team Create</strong> access test together in an environment much like that of a local server. Some of the benefits of doing a team test, in comparison to <strong class="bold">Local Server</strong>, include the fact that you only need to control your own player, character appearances load in, and you can use an API that requires the properties of a real player, such as <strong class="bold">UserId</strong>, for example. A <strong class="bold">UserId</strong> is a unique identifying number that each Roblox profile has. Once you activate <strong class="bold">Team Test</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> icon will change to say <strong class="bold">Join</strong> and additionally, a red shutdown button will appear for when you wish to conclude the session.</p>
			<p>The tools within the <strong class="bold">Emulation</strong> subtab allow you to see how your game would appear to players with different devices and from different regions. This tool is most useful for seeing whether UI within your game is universally scaled across displays of different sizes, how a game controls when testing with emulation set to a different platform, as well as to check that localization is functioning based on a player's region. The first tool is the device emulator. Aside from altering your viewport in Studio while editing, by initializing a test, the control scheme will be based on the selected device's platform, meaning you can evaluate mobile, Xbox, and computer interactions while playing. The second tool is an emulator for a player of your own design. From here, you can manipulate their region and alter what policies are in place for that user for that user so that you can make accommodations as needed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"></a>Customizing Studio to aid your workflow</h2>
			<p>In Roblox Studio, the tab system is a<a id="_idIndexMarker080"></a> convenient and customizable system of organization for some of the tools that are available to you. Once you gain experience as a developer, it is natural that you may desire a layout of the tools you use the most to better fit your workflow. By clicking the down-facing arrow next to the Studio tabs, as depicted in <em class="italic">Figure 2.17</em>, you will be able to add or remove certain actions from the <strong class="bold">Quick Access Toolbar</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_02_17.jpg" alt="Figure 2.17 – This is the customization list for the Quick Access Toolbar
" width="183" height="352">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17 – This is the customization list for the Quick Access Toolbar</p>
			<p>You will be presented first with a list of basic actions to add or remove to your toolbar, but by selecting the <strong class="bold">Customize…</strong> option, a small dialog box will open and show virtually every button-bound <a id="_idIndexMarker081"></a>action you can do in Studio with the click of your mouse. Adding or replacing the default action buttons may improve your experience when working in Studio by increasing your overall efficiency in developing as you will no longer be forced to navigate through multiple pages, in some cases.</p>
			<p>Like customizing your Quick Access Toolbar may increase your efficiency in development, there are also numerous add-ons available to make some tedious or otherwise difficult tasks doable with the click of your mouse. By navigating to the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong> or <strong class="bold">Library</strong> page, you can click the <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> tab and explore a wide variety of plugins that make less-visible information accessible and some impossible actions feasible. As mentioned in the <em class="italic">The Library and Avatar Shop</em> section, you should be cautious of what plugins you install, as you would when adding any asset to your game. Plugins have the ability to execute programs at the highest level of Roblox security in your project and can alter virtually anything in Studio. This is not said to discourage you from using plugins; however, as you become more advanced, they may become necessary and there are many developers that dedicate themselves to making quality plugin tools. Before installing a plugin, simply make sure that it is widely used and has a good rating.</p>
			<p>With what you have learned<a id="_idIndexMarker082"></a> from this section, you can begin manipulating different instances that you have added to the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>, test that your systems function correctly across multiple platforms for different players, and personalize Studio in order to most effectively develop your projects. These skills will be particularly important in the following chapter as you begin using Studio to make your first programs. To be fully well-rounded before you begin programming, it would be beneficial to make use of the documentation and other assets that Roblox offers in order to become more knowledgeable about the development process in general, as well as programming constructs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"></a>Taking advantage of Roblox's resources</h1>
			<p>Another aspect of the<a id="_idIndexMarker083"></a> Roblox platform that makes it unique is the abundance of documentation, tutorials, and other resources that are offered to its developers. When <a id="_idIndexMarker084"></a>we cover more aspects of programming, you will find that the extensive documentation listing nearly every aspect of what you are working with will be of immense value.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"></a>Tutorials and resources</h2>
			<p>To conveniently organize<a id="_idIndexMarker085"></a> information on Lua and other development types, Roblox maintains a separate part of the website for articles and API references. Here, on the developer website, you can learn what functions and events exist for various types of instances, the arguments that each function takes, in addition to logs of Studio updates and documentation on other content relevant to programming.</p>
			<p>The website also grants the <a id="_idIndexMarker086"></a>added benefit of tutorials on several core game systems for beginners. While this book will teach how to program in Lua starting from the simplest of concepts, the additional practice and provided game templates on the developer website are useful for applying what you observe to your own projects. These resources do not require any login or other additional steps to access and can be found here: <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/">https://developer.roblox.com/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"></a>The Developer Forum</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Developer Forum</strong>, more commonly called the <strong class="bold">Dev Forum</strong>, is a section of the Roblox website exclusively <a id="_idIndexMarker087"></a>dedicated to the promotion of developer discussion, collaboration, and quick-response development help. With multiple categories that are devoted to guidance on separate fields of development, most of the obscure issues you may run into when developing a project may be<a id="_idIndexMarker088"></a> resolved within a matter of minutes, if they haven't already been previously resolved by someone with the same complication in the past. </p>
			<p>Before you can post new threads on the forum, you must complete a tutorial and spend a certain amount of time on the website. This is to prevent spam and unwanted content from flooding the various channels. If you build up a reputation on the Dev Forum, earning solutions and likes awarded from other users, you may be promoted to the <strong class="bold">Regular</strong> role. This role demonstrates that you are experienced with the forum and Roblox as a whole, and with it, you are granted access to a few additional channels. Members who most consistently contribute to the overall health and content of the forum may receive the <strong class="bold">Top Contributor</strong> or <strong class="bold">Community Sage</strong> roles. These are reserved and mostly manually given by administrators and are a sign of great experience. Some additional permissions also accompany these roles.</p>
			<p>As mentioned in the previous chapter, staying social and making new connections with other developers is the best thing you can do to advance yourself as a developer and increase your level of recognition on the platform. While the forum is by no means formal, maintaining a semi-professional <a id="_idIndexMarker089"></a>demeanor may help you find promotion quicker. To get started, you can find the Dev Forum here: <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/">https://devforum.roblox.com/</a>.</p>
			<p>By utilizing both the Dev Forum and the Developer website, you will not only gain more confidence as a developer, but you will also be promoting yourself in the community as you help others or receive help yourself.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"></a>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned how to use the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> page of the Roblox website in order to create new games, change external settings, add monetization items, and promote your game for millions of users to see. Moreover, you familiarized yourself with Roblox Studio and you can now create and change the properties of new instances, manage internal game settings, customize Studio to increase your productivity, and manipulate your environment with built-in tools. Lastly, you found the resources that Roblox provides to its developers to advance knowledge, get development help, and network with other members of the community.</p>
			<p>The next chapter will begin by introducing you to the Roblox Lua language and general programming constructs that will be key components of your future as a game developer and programmer in general. By the end of the following chapter, you will be able to make your own programs in Lua with the prowess to utilize proper style and produce optimized code.</p>
