			<h1 id="_idParaDest-78"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"></a>Chapter 4</em>: Roblox Programming Scenarios</h1>
			<p>While you have learned many aspects of programming in a general sense, there are scenarios that apply almost exclusively to game development using Roblox. This chapter will explore Roblox-specific programming, Roblox services, how to manage players, physics manipulation, and other game features.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the client-server model</li>
				<li>Using Roblox services</li>
				<li>Working with physics</li>
				<li>Adding peripheral game aspects</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's get started!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"></a>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Like the previous chapter, you will be working entirely in Studio. You will want an internet connection in order to get the best use out of Roblox Studio, as well as to access the developer website to further explore some of the topics that will be covered. You can find all the code used in this chapter in the book's GitHub repository at - <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Coding-Roblox-Games-Made-Easy/tree/main/Chapter04">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Coding-Roblox-Games-Made-Easy/tree/main/Chapter04</a></p>
			<p>Understanding the client-server model</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">client-server model</strong> is a distributed <a id="_idIndexMarker220"></a>communication structure that can be found throughout many fields of computing. In game development, this type of communication is most often utilized so that the server acts as a provider and verifier for clients who make requests to it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"></a>Different script types</h2>
			<p>Since the server and client are<a id="_idIndexMarker221"></a> separate systems with different defined purposes, programming in Roblox requires that we use unique script instances, depending on whether a script is working with the client (local) or with the server. Additionally, a third type of script exists that can be accessed locally or by the server. These script types and their icons can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – Different script types can be used based on which data model you are working with</p>
			<p>Let's look at each script type and their applications in the following sections.</p>
			<h3>Scripts</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scripts</strong> are used to execute<a id="_idIndexMarker222"></a> code when working with the server and were likely the first script type you were introduced to. To run, they must be a descendant of the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> or <strong class="sou ce-inline">ServerScriptService</strong>, as shown in the <strong class="bold">Explorer</strong> window. Scripts contain <strong class="sou ce-inline">print("Hello World!")</strong> by default. Because scripts operate on the server, they are most often used for overall game management. Scripts will continue to execute until an error is produced, the end of the thread is reached, or they are parented to anywhere they are not permitted to run. Additionally, if the parent of a script is destroyed, the script will be terminated as a result. Since scripts cannot be influenced by individual clients, some Roblox services allow them to use more of what they have to offer; this will be covered more in the <em class="italic">Using Roblox services</em> section.</p>
			<p>Local scripts</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Local scripts</strong> are like server-sided <a id="_idIndexMarker223"></a>scripts but are used when working with the client. Local scripts are the only way to obtain local information about a player, such as camera <strong class="sou ce-inline">CFrame</strong>, mouse properties, physical input, and more. They can only be executed if they are parented to a player's <strong class="sou ce-inline">Backpack</strong>, character, <strong class="sou ce-inline">PlayerGui</strong>, <strong class="bold">PlayerScripts</strong>, or the <strong class="bold">ReplicatedFirst</strong> service. Client scripts have vulnerabilities, in the sense that they can be created and executed by clients with <em class="italic">script injectors</em>. As a result, local scripts do not share all the same permissions to use Roblox services as server scripts do. Since local scripts are dependent on a client, they can identify which client is executing them. For example, if we wanted to return information about a client's mouse, that can be done from a local script; you can assume that the <strong class="sou ce-inline">player</strong> variable is already defined as a <strong class="sou ce-inline">player</strong> instance:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local mouse = player:GetMouse()</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">print(mouse) --nil in server script</p>
			<h3>Modules</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Modules</strong> are a type of script that <a id="_idIndexMarker224"></a>must be accessed by using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">require()</strong> function. Code that is contained within modules will be unable to run until this function is called and, in turn, the returned result is cached. This means that the code in the module itself will not be run multiple times if the <strong class="sou ce-inline">require()</strong> function is repeatedly used, and the module table will always have the same reference. The primary use of modules is to hold functions or other code that can be easily referenced globally rather than isolated to a single script. You may have seen the global identifier (<strong class="sou ce-inline">_G.</strong>) for defining variables or functions, but it is generally considered bad style to use this. Modules can be accessed by either the server or the client, making them useful for storing functions you want to be accessible to both; just be sure to keep them organized. In the following example, we have a module holding a simple function and a separate script calling that function, as denoted by the comments in the code. Notice that the module returns the table where information is stored; this must occur in modules as the previously mentioned <strong class="sou ce-inline">require()</strong> function essentially calls the module to return its contents:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--module</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local module = {}</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">module.initialize = function()</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    print("Initialized")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">return module</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--script</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local mod = require(module)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">mod.initialize()</p>
			<p>Though modules can be created to act as classes, holding functions and other code to be executed, they are also often <a id="_idIndexMarker225"></a>used to hold tables of data, typically using a key string. To demonstrate this, we will use NPC properties as an example. Using a loop, you could set up every NPC in a folder by using their name as an index, and then set the <strong class="bold">Humanoid</strong> properties to the corresponding values that are in the module table. Notice in the following example that the script can index values in the module as if it were a table in the script directly:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--module</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local module = {}</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">module.Heavy = {</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    MaxHealth = 500;</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    Health = 500;</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    WalkSpeed = 11;</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">}</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">return module</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--script</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local mod = require(module)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">print(mod.Heavy.MaxHealth)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"></a>The Script Menu tab</h2>
			<p>Now that you have<a id="_idIndexMarker226"></a> learned about the different script types, it is important you are aware of the tools available to you when working inside them. The <strong class="bold">Script Menu</strong> tab of Studio is only visible when you're inside a <strong class="sou ce-inline">script</strong> instance; you can see this menu in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer037" class="IMG---Figure">

" width="772" height="92">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – The Script Menu tab provides many tools while you're working in scripts</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Navigate</strong> section of the <strong class="bold">Script Menu</strong> tab allows you to move forward or backward through the scripts you currently have open in Studio. You can also simply double-click scripts that are open to return to them or click the associated tab.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> submenu provides several different functionalities, the first being the <strong class="bold">Find</strong> tool. While there are many options you can use with this tool, the most commonly used are the standard <strong class="bold">Find</strong> action (<em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">F</em>), <strong class="bold">Find All</strong> (<em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">F</em>), and <strong class="bold">Go to line</strong> (<em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">G</em>). The <strong class="bold">Find</strong> action is straightforward and simply looks for strings in the current script that match your input. <strong class="bold">Find All</strong> searches all the current script instances within your game for strings that match your input; the results will be returned to you in a new in-Studio window, much like the output window. Finally, <strong class="bold">Go to Line</strong> will bring up a new modal window with a box that asks for you to input a line number. Once inputted, your line selection will move to the specified number and the box will close.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Replace</strong> action will bring up a menu in your script, similar to that of the <strong class="bold">Find</strong> tool, and will prompt you to provide two strings. The first string is what you want to find in your script, while the second is what you want that string to be replaced by. Unfortunately, this feature is limited to working with one script at a time, and you cannot replace all desired strings within all the scripts of your game at once.</p>
			<p>Roblox additionally provides a variety of tools to aid in debugging. For this, you need to be introduced to the concept of <a id="_idIndexMarker227"></a>breakpoints. <strong class="bold">Breakpoints</strong> will pause your test session once the line of code they are associated with is reached. To add a breakpoint, you can simply click the space to the right of a line number when inside of a script, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – You can insert breakpoints to stop your code when a line is reached</p>
			<p>Once a breakpoint has been reached, you can continue through the code line by line by using the <strong class="bold">Step Into</strong>, <strong class="bold">Step Over</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Step Out</strong> options under the <strong class="bold">Debugger</strong> submenu, as shown in the following screenshot. <strong class="bold">Step Into</strong> will continue through your code line by line, entering any functions or code containers that exist elsewhere that are referenced. The <strong class="bold">Step Over</strong> action will skip over any code blocks if the next line would otherwise <a id="_idIndexMarker228"></a>bring you into one. Finally, the <strong class="bold">Step Out</strong> action will take you out of a code block immediately if you have reached one, bringing you to the next line following the container:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4 – The Debugger tool has different actions you can use to progress through code</p>
			<p>Under the <strong class="bold">View</strong> tab of Studio, you can also find the <strong class="bold">Watch</strong> and <strong class="bold">Call Stack</strong> windows. Both serve to provide additional information about what your code is executing when debugging. By toggling the <strong class="bold">Call Stack</strong> view, you can see which processes are currently on the stack; that is, you can see if you are currently in a function, view the order in which functions are called, and see which lines those calls are made from. You may find this feature particularly useful if you are working with a recursive function, as you can see the order of calls. To aid you as you follow your code, you can also toggle the <strong class="bold">Watch</strong> window to see the exact values of the variables and types of expressions within your script. Look at the advantages of using both tools to follow a recursive function, similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>

			<p>Lastly, to assist <a id="_idIndexMarker229"></a>you with style, you can use the <strong class="bold">Format Selection</strong> button to properly indent your code. This feature was recently added and allows you to indent only the code you currently have selected or the entirety of your script. Indentation is automatically ascertained from the location of keywords for code containers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"></a>Filtering Enabled</h2>
			<p>In 2018, Roblox made<a id="_idTextAnchor086"></a> the <strong class="sou ce-inline">FilteringEnabled</strong><strong class="bold"> </strong>setting always set to enabled for all games to prevent<a id="_idIndexMarker230"></a> exploiting from occurring within them. <strong class="sou ce-inline">FilteringEnabled</strong> essentially serves to force a client-server communication structure as opposed to the previous, less verifiable communication and replication method, where clients could directly tell the server what behavior should occur. As a result of this major system change, many existing games were no longer playable because they were not programmed to accommodate this communication style. Today, all projects on Roblox are scripted with <strong class="sou ce-inline">FilteringEnabled</strong> in mind, making use of specific instances, called remotes, to facilitate communication between the client and server.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"></a>RemoteEvents</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">RemoteEvents</strong> are a way for a <a id="_idIndexMarker231"></a>client to communicate with the server and vice versa and are used when no response from the requestee is needed. Often, clients send signals to the server so that the server can fulfill a task on their behalf. To do this, the client must <em class="italic">fire</em> a <strong class="sou ce-inline">RemoteEvent</strong> using the built-in method. It should be noted that this method can only be used when you're working in a client script, so <strong class="bold">RemoveEvents</strong> should be parented to somewhere where they can be easily accessed by the client and server, such as the <strong class="sou ce-inline">ReplicatedStorage</strong> service, which we will cover in more detail later. In the following example, you can see that a client is calling the <strong class="sou ce-inline">FireServer()</strong> method of a pre-defined <strong class="bold">RemoteEvent</strong>:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteEvent:FireServer()</p>
			<p>Once the <strong class="sou ce-inline">FireServer()</strong> method causes the remote to be fired by the client, the signal can only be detected on the server. By using <strong class="sou ce-inline">RemoteEvent</strong> and the standard <strong class="sou ce-inline">Connect()</strong> method, you can create whatever desired behavior you want to occur on the server. This function will never cause the client to yield, even if a <strong class="sou ce-inline">wait()</strong> function is present, because the client and server scripts are two separate threads. Additionally, the client that fired the remote is passed as an argument to the event function when the event is fired; additional arguments can be provided in tuple fashion:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    --Statements</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end)</p>
			<p>This one-way method of communication via <strong class="bold">RemoteEvents</strong> can be reversed so that the server creates a signal that can only be detected by the client; this signal can be received by the client and similarly execute any desired function. There are two methods that can be used to accomplish this. By calling the <strong class="sou ce-inline">FireClient()</strong> method of a <strong class="bold">RemoteEvent</strong> on the server, the specified player will have an event sent to them. Alternatively, you can fire all the clients within the game, as opposed to a specific one, by using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">FireAllClients()</strong> method. This is often useful for global events or notifications rather than looping through individual clients. Arguments can still be provided to the client as a tuple:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteEvent:FireClient(player) --Sends signal to single client</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteEvent:FireAllClients() --Sends signal to all clients</p>
			<p>Much like using <strong class="sou ce-inline">OnServerEvent</strong> when processing a client request, clients can detect these signals in local scripts by using <strong class="sou ce-inline">OnClientEvent</strong> and, similarly, associate them with a function. In the following example, a client is receiving a signal from a <strong class="bold">RemoteEvent</strong> that has been fired by the server. Here, you can see that this remote is sending a signal to all the clients to accomplish a task that can only be done locally, sending a default notification using <strong class="bold">StarterGui</strong>, a part of Roblox's services. This will be covered in the <em class="italic">Using Roblox services</em> section:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--server</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">wait(5)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteEvent:FireAllClients("Game over!", "Blue team has won!")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--client</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local starterGui = game:GetService("StarterGui")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteEvent.OnClientEvent:Connect(function(title, text)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    starterGui:SetCore("SendNotification", {</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">        Title = title;</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">        Text = text;</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    })</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end)</p>
			<p>A very common use case for a <strong class="bold">RemoteEvent</strong> is for a client to fire one in order to damage another player. These damage remotes will most likely be required for all the weapons in your game if your hit detection is being done on the client. Hit detection on the client is necessary in most cases, as latency on the server makes its use unreliable. If a client is exploiting, they can provide different arguments to a <strong class="bold">RemoteEvent</strong>. Consequently, you should make sure that you <a id="_idIndexMarker232"></a>are getting information from the server whenever possible. Do not let clients tell the server how much damage should be dealt or the weapon they are currently using. The use of <strong class="bold">sanity checks</strong> to make sure the values<a id="_idIndexMarker233"></a> provided make sense is the best way to protect your game in this situation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"></a>RemoteFunctions</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">RemoteFunctions</strong> are similar to <strong class="bold">Remote</strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker234"></a></strong><strong class="bold">Events</strong> but have the ability to return information across the client-server boundary. The primary use of this type of instance is to retrieve information that would normally not be accessible to the server from the client or vice versa. In the following code, a client is making a request using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">InvokeServer()</strong> method of a <strong class="sou ce-inline">RemoteFunction</strong>:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteFunction:InvokeServer()</p>
			<p>Formatting the function that receives a signal from a <strong class="sou ce-inline">RemoteFunction</strong> invocation is slightly different than when using <strong class="bold">RemoteEvents</strong>. <strong class="bold">RemoteFunctions</strong> do not use the <strong class="sou ce-inline">Connect()</strong> method to link their signals to functions. Instead a function is directly assigned to them, called a <strong class="bold">callback</strong>. In the<a id="_idIndexMarker235"></a> following code, the server is receiving the signal from the client's previous request by using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">OnServerInvoke</strong> event. Notice that like <strong class="bold">RemoteEvents</strong>, the client that made the request to the instance becomes a parameter of the assigned function:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteFunction.OnServerInvoke = function(player)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    return --optional but use a RemoteEvent for subroutines</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end</p>
			<p>The direction of communication can once again be switched, similar to <strong class="bold">RemoteEvents</strong>, to create requests to the client from the server. For this behavior, <strong class="bold">RemoteFunctions</strong> use the <strong class="sou ce-inline">InvokeClient()</strong> method:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteFunction:InvokeClient(player)</p>
			<p>The following code shows how the request that was sent can be received by the client. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">OnClientInvoke</strong> callback of a <strong class="bold">RemoteFunction</strong> is used to assign a function to a request. Here, we can see that the server is requesting the <strong class="sou ce-inline">CFrame</strong> of the client's camera, which normally cannot be accessed by the server. Notice that the function that's been assigned to the event can still be defined in other places. It is important to note that while you can assign many separate functions to a <strong class="bold">RemoteEvent</strong>, you can only assign one callback to <strong class="bold">RemoteFunction</strong> instances; attempting to assign another will simply overwrite the previous assignment:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--server</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local clientCamCFrame = RemoteFunction:InvokeClient(player)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--client</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local cam = workspace.CurrentCamera</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local function getCamCFrame()</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    return cam.CFrame</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    </p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">RemoteFunction.OnClientInvoke = getCamCFrame</p>
			<p>Much like <a id="_idIndexMarker236"></a>checking what arguments a client sends to a <strong class="bold">RemoteEvent</strong>, requesting information from a client using a <strong class="bold">RemoteFunction</strong> can also be compromised if a player is using a script injector or any other means to exploit. To resolve this, ensure that you employ checks and only request information from the client when absolutely needed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"></a>BindableEvents and BindableFunctions</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">BindableEvents</strong> and <strong class="bold">BindableFunctions</strong> are much like<a id="_idIndexMarker237"></a> <strong class="bold">RemoteEvents</strong> and <strong class="bold">RemoteFunctions</strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker238"></a></strong> except that when they are fired, their signals can only be detected by the data mode that fired it, which can<a id="_idIndexMarker239"></a> be either the server or the client. This has useful applications if you want to make your own signals for functions to be connected to, or if you want scripts to directly communicate with each other.</p>
			<p>To demonstrate how we can <a id="_idIndexMarker240"></a>apply such instances, we will just look at <strong class="bold">BindableFunctions</strong>. In the following code, we are effectively calling a function that only exists in a server script, separate<a id="_idIndexMarker241"></a> from the one we are invoking the remote from. Notice<a id="_idIndexMarker242"></a> that with the use of a <strong class="bold">BindableFunction</strong>, we can retrieve a value that's been returned by a function without directly indexing what function we wish to be called. The keywords that are used for invocations and assigning a callback to a <strong class="bold">BindableFunction</strong> are nearly identical to when using a remote, those being <strong class="sou ce-inline">Invoke()</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">OnInvoke</strong> for <strong class="bold">BindableFunctions</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">Fire()</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">Event</strong> when using <strong class="bold">BindableEvents</strong>. Take a look at the following output, which shows what happens when these two server scripts communicate with each other to accomplish a task:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--script 1</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local function sum(...)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    local sum = 0</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    local nums = {...}</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    </p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    for _, num in pairs(nums) do</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">        sum = sum + num</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    end</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    return sum</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">Function.OnInvoke = sum</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--script 2</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local sum = Function:Invoke(2, 4, 11)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">print(sum)  17</p>
			<p>With that, you<a id="_idIndexMarker243"></a> have learned how different types of scripts work <a id="_idIndexMarker244"></a>between the client and server and how to facilitate communication in a <strong class="sou ce-inline">FilteringEnabled</strong> environment. Moving forward, you <a id="_idIndexMarker245"></a>will learn about<a id="_idIndexMarker246"></a> the additional functionality you can introduce to your programs by making use of Roblox services.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"></a>Using Roblox services</h1>
			<p>With your programming<a id="_idIndexMarker247"></a> experience so far, you have created scripts that are limited only to the functionality of built-in language features or the methods and events of instances. In Roblox, the use of <strong class="bold">services</strong> is necessary to add more complex behaviors and make use of additional events and methods that are needed within your game. You can think of these services as libraries that are used to work with different aspects of your game rather than specific data types.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"></a>Players service</h2>
			<p>Virtually every game makes <a id="_idIndexMarker248"></a>use of the <strong class="sou ce-inline">Players</strong><strong class="bold"> service</strong>. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">Players</strong> service is visible within the <strong class="bold">Explorer</strong> window and is where all <strong class="sou ce-inline">player</strong> instances are kept. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">PlayerAdded</strong> event is a very commonly utilized event and is used to identify when a player joins a game server. The following code looks to print the name of any player who joins the game with a small message attached. Notice that the player who joins the game is provided as a parameter to the function associated with the event:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local playersService = game:GetService("Players")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">playersService.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    print(player.Name.. " joined the game.")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end)</p>
			<p>A counterpart event also exists for checking when a player leaves the game: the <strong class="sou ce-inline">PlayerRemoving</strong> event. Note that this function processes before the <strong class="sou ce-inline">player</strong> instance has been removed from the service, meaning you can manage or retrieve information from the <strong class="sou ce-inline">player</strong> instance, which is passed as a parameter to the function:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">playersService.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    print(player.Name.. " left the game.")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end)</p>
			<p>While you may elect not to show a player's stats to everyone in a server, doing so may inspire competition and keep people playing for longer. To do this, Roblox has a built-in system called <strong class="sou ce-inline">leaderstats</strong>, which many games use to create leaderboards as it does not require additional UI features for it to be implemented. In the following screenshot, a player's <strong class="bold">Gold</strong> stat is displayed in the player list using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">leaderstats</strong> system. If there were more players in the game, players' names would be displayed in the order of their stat level, from highest to lowest:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_04_06.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – You can display information in the player list by using the leaderstats system
" width="256" height="115">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6 – You can display information in the player list by using the leaderstats system</p>
			<p>Let's look at how we can create our own leaderboard for when someone new joins the game. Each player must have a <strong class="sou ce-inline">leaderstats</strong> folder for the system to work, so it is best to use a <strong class="sou ce-inline">PlayerAdded</strong> event to add the needed elements to a new <strong class="sou ce-inline">player</strong> instance. While any instance can be used to hold the name <em class="italic">leaderstats</em>, it makes the most sense conceptually to use something such as a folder. Once created and named, the folder should be parented directly to the <strong class="sou ce-inline">player</strong> instance that's provided to us by the event. Next, create <a id="_idIndexMarker249"></a>value instances based on which data type you want to be displayed; in the following example, we're creating an <strong class="sou ce-inline">IntValue</strong> that represents how much <strong class="bold">Gold</strong> the player has. While any number of values can be added to the <strong class="sou ce-inline">leaderstats</strong> folder, only the first four will be displayed. Moreover, player names will only be sorted in the list based on the first stat that is created:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">playersService.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    local folder = Instance.new("Folder")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    folder.Name = "leaderstats"</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    folder.Parent = player</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    local gold = Instance.new("IntValue")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    gold.Name = "Gold"</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    gold.Parent = folder</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end)</p>
			<p>Another common use of the <strong class="sou ce-inline">Players</strong> service is when working on the client. In order to identify which player is executing a local script, you should index the <strong class="sou ce-inline">LocalPlayer</strong> property of the service. If you were to index that property inside of a server script, it would be <strong class="sou ce-inline">nil</strong>. Once the local player has been indexed, an abundance of functions and additional information becomes available:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local player = playersService.LocalPlayer --nil in reg. script</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">print(player.UserId) --ID unique to each Roblox user</p>
			<p>For a final example, we will be using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">GetPlayers()</strong> method of the <strong class="sou ce-inline">Players</strong> service in order to iterate over all the clients currently in the game. The following code uses a loop to set the <strong class="sou ce-inline">WalkSpeed</strong> property of all the players in the game to <strong class="sou ce-inline">30</strong>. It should be noted that a loop structured such as this should not be made to yield unless certain checks are in place. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker250"></a>because a player can leave in the time it takes for the code to execute, then causing problems as that client would still exist in the table of players that's returned by the <strong class="sou ce-inline">GetPlayers()</strong> method but not within the game itself:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local players = playersService:GetPlayers()</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">for _, player in pairs(players) do</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    local char = player.Character</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    if char then</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">        print(char.Name.. "'s speed is now 30.") </p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">        char.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 30</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    end</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"></a>ReplicatedStorage and ServerStorage</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="sou ce-inline">ReplicatedStorage</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">ServerStorage</strong> services are convenient places to store and manage <a id="_idIndexMarker251"></a>assets within your game. Each location has different<a id="_idIndexMarker252"></a> behaviors and optimizations when content is added to them, but neither of these services have unique methods or properties.</p>
			<p>The assets in <strong class="sou ce-inline">ReplicatedStorage</strong> can be accessed by the client but are not visually rendered, allowing for some performance increases when unnecessary assets are moved there in a live game setting. As we mentioned previously, both local and server scripts must be parented to specific locations to be able to run. When scripts of any type are parented to a storage service, they will not run until they are moved to an area where they can. This behavior could be compared to the <strong class="sou ce-inline">Disabled</strong> property of a script going from <strong class="sou ce-inline">true</strong> to <strong class="sou ce-inline">false</strong>.</p>
			<p>When assets are contained within <strong class="sou ce-inline">ServerStorage</strong>, they can only be accessed by the server. This behavior makes <strong class="sou ce-inline">ServerStorage</strong> the choice place for storing instances such as modules (those that aren't used by the client) as clients cannot retrieve the modules' contents. Furthermore, physical instances from our <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> that are stored in <strong class="sou ce-inline">ServerStorage</strong> will not produce either memory or a rendering load on the client. This provides a greater performance increase than storing something in <strong class="sou ce-inline">ReplicatedStorage</strong>, though the use cases for this service are different in most circumstances.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"></a>StarterGui</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">StarterGui</strong> service is a hub for<a id="_idIndexMarker253"></a> a multitude of both core and custom user interface functionalities. <strong class="bold">Graphical user interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUIs</strong>) can be created <a id="_idIndexMarker254"></a>by you, with the service acting as a container and your UI-associated instances being visible on screen when parented to the service in Studio, as shown in the following screenshot. When running the game, your UI is copied from here and parented to the <strong class="sou ce-inline">PlayerGui</strong> container under a client. More information on UI and its direct scripting implications will be covered in <a href="B16623_06_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml.html#_idTextAnchor120"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating a Battle Royale Game</em>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7 – Parenting GUI instances to StarterGui makes them visible on screen while in Studio</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">StarterGui</strong> is also used as an interface to interact with and manipulate core GUI features. In the following example, the service can be used to completely disable a portion <a id="_idIndexMarker255"></a>of the core UI using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">SetCoreGuiEnabled()</strong> method. To use it, simply specify which UI you want to be affected and provide a bool representing whether that UI should be enabled or disabled:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local starterGui = game:GetService("StarterGui")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">starterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled(Enum.CoreGuiType.PlayerList, false)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"></a>StarterPack and StarterPlayer</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterPack</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterPlayer</strong> services are a convenient way of defining initializing behaviors for players and what they spawn with. <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterPlayer</strong> allows you to define default <a id="_idIndexMarker256"></a>properties for the <strong class="sou ce-inline">Humanoid</strong> instances used as <a id="_idIndexMarker257"></a>player characters by changing the properties of the service itself, as shown in the following screenshot. It should be noted that when you're changing the default behavior under the <strong class="bold">World</strong> tab of the <strong class="bold">Game Settings</strong> menu, these are the values that are physically changed:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8 – Changing the properties under StarterPlayer will change the default player behavior</p>
			<p>Additionally, you can store scripts in two locations with different behaviors. Parenting scripts to <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterPlayerScripts</strong> will cause that script to run from the time the player joins the game without ever resetting. This makes it the optimal place to put a <em class="italic">local handler</em>, a local <a id="_idIndexMarker258"></a>script that manages all subsequent modules; we will cover physical script infrastructure more in the next chapter. When either local or <a id="_idIndexMarker259"></a>server scripts are parented to <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterCharacterScripts</strong>, those scripts will be placed directly into a player's character model each time they spawn. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterCharacterScripts</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterPlayerScripts</strong> instances do not have any additional methods or properties.</p>
			<p>In terms of the <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterPack</strong>, anything that's parented here is put in the player's <strong class="bold">Backpack</strong> instance once they spawn. <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> are some of the most common items that are put here when you want players to spawn with them by default. Any <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> you wish to add later can be put directly into the <strong class="bold">Backpack</strong> under the player. Like <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterCharacterScripts</strong>, <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterPack</strong> resets its contents whenever a player respawns, meaning that if you want a <strong class="bold">LocalScript</strong> to be executed each time the player spawns, you can parent that script to <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterPack</strong>. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">StarterPack</strong> itself does not have any unique properties or methods.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"></a>PhysicsService</h2>
			<p><strong class="sou ce-inline">PhysicsService</strong> is a way of <a id="_idIndexMarker260"></a>managing collisions between <a id="_idIndexMarker261"></a>objects in your game via the use of <strong class="bold">collision groups</strong>. In your game, you can have up to 32 collision groups and determine how these groups interact with each other.</p>
			<p>In the following code, we are making a collision group for player characters so that players cannot collide with each other. This may be a convenient feature of an obby (obstacle course), or any other type of game where players could be negatively affected by running into others. Collision groups can be created by using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">CreateCollisionGroup()</strong> method of <strong class="sou ce-inline">PhysicsService</strong>. This method simply takes a unique string that can be easily referenced for operations later. Next, we do not want players to be able to collide with each other. The parts of all the player characters will be in one collision group, meaning that we can set the group so that it can't collide with itself. To do this, we can use the <strong class="sou ce-inline">CollisionGroupSetCollidable()</strong> method, which takes two collision groups and a Boolean value to determine whether those two groups can collide. Next, by creating a function using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">player.CharacterAdded</strong> event, which is often used within a <strong class="sou ce-inline">PlayerAdded</strong> event function, a loop is used to iterate over all of the <strong class="sou ce-inline">BasePart</strong> instances within the character. Once found, the parts are assigned to the <strong class="sou ce-inline">"Players"</strong> collision group using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">SetPartCollisionGroup()</strong> method, which takes a <strong class="sou ce-inline">BasePart</strong> instance and a collision group name as its arguments:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local physics = game:GetService("PhysicsService")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">physics:CreateCollisionGroup("Players")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">physics:CollisionGroupSetCollidable("Players", "Players", false)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function(char)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    for _, part in pairs(char:GetDescendants()) do</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">        if part:IsA("BasePart") then</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">            physics:SetPartCollisionGroup(part, "Players")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">        end</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    end</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    print(player.Name.. " added to group!")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"></a>UserInputService</h2>
			<p><strong class="sou ce-inline">UserInputService</strong> is a service<a id="_idIndexMarker262"></a> that's used in local scripts to detect physical input from a client. It can be used to read input from a player's mouse, keyboard, or any other input device, as well as to determine certain input behaviors.</p>
			<p>Let's say that you are looking to detect keyboard input from the client. You can check if a player is even using a keyboard by viewing the value of the <strong class="sou ce-inline">UIS.KeyboardEnabled</strong> property. To detect input of any type, you can use the <strong class="sou ce-inline">InputBegan</strong> event; it specifies what the input was and if the user was interacting with any user interface when that input occurred. In the following example, we are creating what could be some arbitrary interact function that's linked to pressing <em class="italic">E</em> on a player's keyboard. We do not want this function to run if the client simply pressed the interact key while writing a chat message, so we will immediately return if they were engaging with any UI elements. Next, since we are looking for keyboard input, we can check the <strong class="sou ce-inline">KeyCode</strong> enum (enumeration) of the input and compare it to the desired character using the <strong class="sou ce-inline">KeyCode</strong> enum:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local UIS = game:GetService("UserInputService")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">UIS.InputBegan:Connect(function(input, typing)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    if typing then return end</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    </p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    if input.KeyCode == Enum.KeyCode.E then</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">        print("Client pressed E!")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">    end</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">end)</p>
			<p>While most services that are practical for a beginner to learn have been covered, you can visit the developer website to learn about what others exist and learn more information regarding their applications. Once on the page, search for <strong class="sou ce-inline">service</strong> using your browser's Find tool to find the services among the other classes listed:</p>
			<p><a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/index">https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/index</a></p>
			<p>Services are a core component of creating any Roblox game and now that you have learned <a id="_idIndexMarker263"></a>how to utilize them, you can create much more comprehensive systems or even apply lower-level events and methods that would otherwise be inaccessible without defining the service you wish to use. In future chapters, when you build your own games, you will use these services in various applications, from player management to game mechanics.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"></a>Working with physics</h1>
			<p>Depending on<a id="_idIndexMarker264"></a> whether you are working as a frontend or backend programmer for a project, essentially meaning you're working with the code infrastructure or with what players see, respectively, working with physics may be something you do on a daily basis. While physics directly correlate with math and a backend programmer may work with <strong class="bold">CFrames</strong> and math much more intensely, a frontend programmer needs to work with physical forces in the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>. There are several ways to do this; that is, with properties, <strong class="bold">constraints</strong>, or <strong class="bold">body movers</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"></a>Constraints</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="sou ce-inline">Constraint</strong> base class<a id="_idIndexMarker265"></a> consists of instances that can be utilized to create different physical behaviors within your games. Most constraints require <strong class="sou ce-inline">Attachment</strong> instances in order to work. These <strong class="bold">Attachments</strong> must be parented to a <strong class="sou ce-inline">BasePart</strong> instance and serve mainly as a single point in a space that constraints can reference.</p>
			<p>To make the process of setting up constraints easier, you can use the <strong class="bold">Constraints</strong> submenu under the <strong class="bold">Model</strong> tab of Studio. This menu allows you to create new constraints without needing to create the attachments for them yourself. Additionally, it includes a convenient dropdown list of all constraint instances, as shown in the following screenshot. Furthermore, you can also view constraints in the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>, even for those that are normally invisible, by toggling the <strong class="bold">Constraint Details</strong> option:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer044" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/coding-roblox-games/9781800561991/image/B16623_04_09.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9 – There are a variety of constraints that can be used to create unique physical behaviors
" width="287" height="451">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9 – There are a variety of constraints that can be used to create unique physical behaviors</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Rod</strong> constraint is used for keeping parts a set distance from each other, keeping them aligned with a rigid axis created from the two <strong class="bold">Attachments</strong>. Though these parts are kept aligned with<a id="_idIndexMarker266"></a> each other, they can still freely rotate around their <strong class="bold">Attachments</strong>. The two primary properties of this instance are <strong class="bold">Thickness</strong> and <strong class="bold">Length</strong>, with <strong class="bold">Length</strong> being the distance between the two parts and <strong class="bold">Thickness</strong> being the visual thickness of the constraint. You can also view the current distance between the attachments, and subsequently the parts, by checking the <strong class="bold">CurrentDistance</strong> property, which cannot be written to.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Rope</strong> constraint is an instance that's used to simulate a rope-like connection between two parts. <strong class="bold">Rope</strong> constraints are similar to <strong class="bold">Rod</strong> constraints in that they share the same properties, though <strong class="bold">Rope</strong> constraints have a dampening property called <strong class="bold">Restitution</strong>, which is used to adjust how aggressively the rope resumes its original length once force is exerted upon it. To help you conceptualize this constraint better, it is much like a <strong class="bold">Rod</strong> but lacks rigidity – such is the nature of a rope.</p>
			<p>In Roblox, <strong class="bold">welding</strong> is a way of making <a id="_idIndexMarker267"></a>parts stay connected while<a id="_idIndexMarker268"></a> they are unanchored. There are several types of instances that can be used for making welds, but older weld types break when any of the parts are moved individually with the Studio building tools. They also alter the <strong class="sou ce-inline">CFrame</strong> of parts when a new weld is created between them. While some of these effects can be negated with code, it is sometimes easier to use a <strong class="bold">Weld</strong> constraint instance. By using a <strong class="bold">Weld</strong> constraint, you can weld parts together to keep their original positions and have free range of moving the parts once they have been welded, without the connection between them breaking. By toggling <strong class="bold">Show Welds</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Model</strong> tab, you can view connections like this in Studio, as shown in the following image: </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"></a>Body movers</h2>
			<p>Instances of the <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyMover</strong> base class<a id="_idIndexMarker270"></a> are a convenient way of consistently applying forces directly or applying forces to accomplish a goal when working with <strong class="sou ce-inline">BasePart</strong> instances. <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyMover</strong> instances will only have an effect if they're parented to <strong class="sou ce-inline">BasePart</strong> instances. This means that if you wanted an entire model to move, the parts would need to be welded together with the <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyMover</strong> instance in a central part:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11 – There are six body mover instances, each with different behaviors</p>
			<p><strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyForce</strong> is a <strong class="bold">Body Mover</strong> instance that applies a force to the instance it is parented to. This force is applied on a world space basis, meaning that it is not relative to the orientation of the part itself. The primary property of this instance is <strong class="bold">Force</strong>, a <strong class="sou ce-inline">Vector3</strong> that is applied to the center of mass of the part. Though applying direct force has many practical examples and in the following code, we will make a part locally experience zero gravity. To do this, we need a basic understanding of physics and the <strong class="sou ce-inline">GetMass()</strong> method of <strong class="sou ce-inline">BasePart</strong> instances. The force that must be used to suspend the part in the air is its mass multiplied by gravity, applied upward on the <em class="italic">Y</em> axis:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local part = workspace.Part</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local bodyForce = Instance.new("BodyForce")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyForce.Parent = part</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local requiredForce = part:GetMass() * workspace.Gravity</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyForce.Force = Vector3.new(0,requiredForce,0)</p>
			<p><strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyVelocity</strong> is another <strong class="bold">Body Mover</strong> instance that similarly operates on the world space. This instance is particularly<a id="_idIndexMarker271"></a> useful when you want to set an object's velocity to be consistent without the need of a loop. The two main properties of this <strong class="bold">Body Mover</strong> are <strong class="sou ce-inline">MaxForce</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">Velocity</strong>. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">MaxForce</strong> is a <strong class="sou ce-inline">Vector3</strong> property and represents the amount of force that is applied to a part when a velocity is set. This means that if a part's mass is greater than the mover's <strong class="sou ce-inline">MaxForce</strong> multiplied by gravity on a given axis, that part will be unable to move along that axis. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">Velocity</strong> property is also a <strong class="sou ce-inline">Vector3</strong> and simply needs to be set to the desired velocity.</p>
			<p>In the following example, we have a part moving forward relative to its front face. Notice that we set each component of the <strong class="sou ce-inline">MaxForce</strong> property to <strong class="sou ce-inline">math.huge</strong>, an essentially infinite value; this is so that the mover will be able to influence the part, regardless of the part's mass. As your skills become more advanced, you may want to adjust the value that's used for this property to prevent any unwanted behaviors, but for the examples shown here, this is optimal. By multiplying the desired speed by the forward-facing directional vector of the part, or the <strong class="sou ce-inline">LookVector</strong> component of its <strong class="sou ce-inline">CFrame</strong>, we can create a world space velocity that is still moving forward relative to the front face of the part. It is recommended that you run this code in the <strong class="bold">Command Bar</strong> area, or even have it in a server script and test it on <strong class="bold">Run</strong> mode for easier observation:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local Part1 = workspace.Part1</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local bodyVelocity = Instance.new("BodyVelocity")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local huge = math.huge</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyVelocity.MaxForce = Vector3.new(huge,huge,huge)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyVelocity.Parent = Part1</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local projectileVel = 5</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local moverVel = Part1.CFrame.LookVector * projectileVel</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyVelocity.Velocity = moverVel</p>
			<p>While you could set the part's <strong class="sou ce-inline">CFrame</strong> to look at a target and always move it forward using the previous example, you can create a velocity aimed at a target without manipulating the part directly. Using the previously configured <strong class="bold">Body Mover</strong>, we can calculate a new <a id="_idIndexMarker272"></a>directional vector, with its origin at the part the mover is currently parented to and its target being the position of another part. In the following code, we are calculating the new vector by doing a simple calculation. By subtracting the first position vector from the second, we are given a new directional vector where the first position looks toward the second. Note that the target part, <strong class="sou ce-inline">Part2</strong>, should be anchored for this example. You may also notice the use of <strong class="sou ce-inline">Unit</strong> with <strong class="sou ce-inline">LookVector</strong>. This is happening to normalize the vector so that it has a magnitude of <em class="italic">1</em>, which is important. The vector components of <strong class="bold">CFrames</strong> will always have a magnitude of <em class="italic">1</em>; notice how differently the behavior of the part's <strong class="bold">Body Mover</strong> is without the use of a normalized vector. You can simply replace every line after <strong class="sou ce-inline">projectileVel</strong> in the previous example with the following code:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local Part2 = workspace.Part2</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local lookVector = (Part2.Position - Part1.Position).Unit</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--p2 – p1 = directional vector at p1 looking at p2</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local moverVel = lookVector * projectileVel</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyVelocity.Velocity = moverVel</p>
			<p>The <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyPosition</strong> instance operates on the world space and works slightly differently than the previously listed <strong class="bold">Body Movers</strong>. <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyPosition</strong> has four primary properties, those being <strong class="sou ce-inline">Position</strong>, <strong class="sou ce-inline">MaxForce</strong>, <strong class="sou ce-inline">P</strong>, and <strong class="sou ce-inline">D</strong>. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">P</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">D</strong> properties are used to determine how aggressively a goal is reached and how much dampening is used in trying to accomplish that goal. You can leave these properties at their default values unless you know what you are doing and want to change them. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">MaxForce</strong> property behaves in the same way as it does with <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyVelocity</strong> instances. <strong class="sou ce-inline">Position</strong> is a Vector3 property and represents where <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyPosition</strong> is attempting to move the part, calculating and applying the necessary forces to meet that goal automatically. In the following example, <strong class="sou ce-inline">MaxForce</strong> has again been set to <strong class="sou ce-inline">math.huge</strong> and the <strong class="sou ce-inline">Position</strong> property has been set to the origin of the <strong class="bold">Workspace</strong> area, plus <em class="italic">15</em> studs on the <em class="italic">Y</em> axis. You should <a id="_idIndexMarker273"></a>see the part smoothly transition between its original position and its new goal:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local part = workspace.Part</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local bodyPosition = Instance.new("BodyPosition")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local huge = math.huge</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyPosition.MaxForce = Vector3.new(huge,huge,huge)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyPosition.Parent = part</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyPosition.Position = Vector3.new(0,15,0)</p>
			<p>The <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyGyro</strong> instance is a way of making a part match an orientation that's been provided by a <strong class="sou ce-inline">CFrame</strong>. The two properties of interest regarding this instance are <strong class="sou ce-inline">MaxTorque</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">CFrame</strong>. In the following example, the part will transition between its current orientation to its orientation when turned <em class="italic">45</em> degrees (pi/4 radians) around the <em class="italic">Z</em> axis. Notice that the <strong class="sou ce-inline">MaxTorque</strong> property is once again set to an infinite value so that it can manipulate a part of any mass:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local bodyGyro = Instance.new("BodyGyro")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local huge = math.huge</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyGyro.MaxTorque = Vector3.new(huge,huge,huge)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyGyro.Parent = part</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyGyro.CFrame = part.CFrame * CFrame.fromOrientation(0,0, math.pi/4)</p>
			<p><strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyThrust</strong> is a <strong class="bold">Body Mover</strong> that applies force to a part relative to its direction. Thrust constantly applies force, much like a <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyForce</strong> instance, which is useful for simulating acceleration or, with some math, a constant speed based on the force counteracting the part. This instance differs from <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyForce</strong> since it operates in the object space, which is convenient for thrusters or engines, though the <strong class="bold">Rocket Propulsion</strong> instance may be more useful in some circumstances. The key properties of the <strong class="bold">Body Thrust</strong> instance are <strong class="sou ce-inline">Force</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">Location</strong>. <strong class="sou ce-inline">Force</strong> behaves in the same way that it does with the <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyForce</strong> instance. The <strong class="sou ce-inline">Location</strong> property determines where the force is applied relative to the part, meaning that the thrust does not need to be applied at the center of mass of the <strong class="bold">Body Mover's</strong> parent. In the following example, a <strong class="sou ce-inline">BodyThrust</strong> will be<a id="_idIndexMarker274"></a> added to a part with a force twice that of gravity, causing the part to speedily accelerate upward:</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local bodyThrust = Instance.new("BodyThrust")</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyThrust.Parent = part</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">local requiredForce = part:GetMass() * workspace.Gravity * 2</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">bodyThrust.Force = Vector3.new(0,requiredForce,0)</p>
			<p class="sou ce-code">--Force will be applied upwards relative to part orientation</p>
			<p>Now that you have learned how to interact with physics in Roblox outside of a purely mathematical environment, you can create even more complex game mechanics and visual effects within your game to provide a better experience to your audience.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"></a>Adding peripheral game aspects</h1>
			<p>For your game to be <a id="_idIndexMarker275"></a>complete, you must be able to work with the more peripheral aspects of a project. Having the ability to manage sometimes overlooked project details such as sound, lighting, and other effects will make you more experienced and consequently more valuable as a member of a team.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"></a>Sound</h2>
			<p>In game development, sound is a <a id="_idIndexMarker276"></a>very important aspect of making your players feel completely captivated by whatever is occurring in a scene or portion of gameplay. While proper sound design is its own subject, it is important that you know where to find sounds and how to manipulate them inside Roblox.</p>
			<p>There are several routes you can take to acquire the right sounds, those being searching for audio in the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong>, looking for models in the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong> that may contain the sound you need, or uploading your own audio files to Roblox. The first option can be done through the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong> or Roblox library web page. Using the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong> or library, you can simply navigate to the audio page and input a keyword; then, the most relevant results will be shown to you. When searching for music or sounds this way, it may be helpful to know that most of the results will be audio uploaded by Roblox. Roblox has licensing agreements with the music companies <strong class="bold">APM</strong> and <strong class="bold">Monstercat</strong> in order to provide music to developers without additional costs or attribution. If you are looking specifically for sound effects, you can use the audio length tool in the <strong class="bold">Toolbox</strong> area to find sounds meeting your length criteria, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.12 – Filters make it easier for you to find what you are looking for in the toolbox</p>
			<p>For the second option, set your search to look through models and look for models that are likely to contain what sounds you are looking for. Sometimes, this is more helpful than looking for <a id="_idIndexMarker277"></a>audio directly because often, audio clips are not named in a way that makes them easy to discover. Lastly, you can upload your own audio assets to Roblox for a small fee, which is dependent on the length of the track.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">You need to be aware that, when uploading audio, the sounds you upload are still subject to copyright laws. For example, uploading your favorite song from a certain band would make you liable to receive moderation action against your account if Roblox receives a DMCA from the copyright holder. Roblox does, however, have a few systems in place to protect you. When uploading audio, a bot checks for copyrighted material and will block the content from being uploaded if any is detected. If you still manage to get the sound uploaded and a DMCA is filed, Roblox employs a three-strike copyright offense system. Upon your third failure to observe copyright laws, your account may be subject to suspension or termination. So, while it is perfectly fine to upload audio, make sure you either hold copyright over what you are uploading or have been given the appropriate license to use that audio in your game. </p>
			<p>In late 2016, Roblox released a long-anticipated sound update that allowed for real-time audio manipulation. Sound <a id="_idIndexMarker278"></a>modifiers are a convenient way of changing sound behavior without the need to alter sounds in external software and reupload them. Using these effects may make your environments or game system more immersive; for example, making use of an echo modifier in a tunnel or changing the pitch of an engine when accelerating:</p>

			<p>For more information about the different behaviors of sound modifiers, please read this Roblox blog post from <a id="_idIndexMarker279"></a>when they were introduced. The post details the effect each instance has and their various properties: <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2016/11/1/">https://blog.roblox.com/2016/11/1/</a></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"></a>Lighting</h2>
			<p>Much like sound, lighting is<a id="_idIndexMarker280"></a> equally as important when creating an attractive environment within your game. When working on a team, a builder may be able to fulfill your lighting needs, but knowing how to configure lighting so that it's attractive in your games is a good skill to possess, regardless of the role you are trying to fulfill.</p>
			<p>The first way you can configure lighting for your game is via the properties of the <strong class="bold">Lighting</strong> service, which is visible under the <strong class="bold">Explorer</strong> window. Some of these properties can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>One of the most used properties of <strong class="bold">Lighting</strong> is <strong class="bold">ClockTime</strong>. This property ranges from <em class="italic">0</em> to <em class="italic">24</em> and<a id="_idIndexMarker281"></a> represents the hours within the day. It can be easily modified in a loop to create day and night cycles.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Technology</strong> section of <strong class="bold">Lighting</strong> allows you to choose between which type of lighting technology is used in your game. The current types of lighting technologies are <strong class="bold">Compatibility</strong>, <strong class="bold">Voxel</strong>, <strong class="bold">ShadowMap</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Future</strong>. Each lighting technology serves to render lighting in your game in a different way. Let's take a look: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Compatibility</strong> option renders light in a close approximation of the Legacy lighting style, which was removed in favor of the current <strong class="bold">Future is Bright</strong> lighting technology.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Voxel</strong> lighting option renders light in a similar way to <strong class="bold">Compatibility</strong> but uses a <em class="italic">4x4x4</em> (<strong class="bold">voxel</strong>) grid for<a id="_idIndexMarker282"></a> shadow calculations. This makes it more performant than some other lighting technologies, as shadows are less defined.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">ShadowMap</strong> option renders shadows with high resolution. However, it is more performant than the <strong class="bold">Future</strong> lighting technology because it does not produce accurate reflections in most circumstances. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Future</strong> is the newest<a id="_idIndexMarker283"></a> lighting technology option and supports advanced, high detail shadows, as well as more realistic reflections on surfaces, from a variety of sources. The only con of this technology is that rendering in those additional visual details takes up more resources, lowering the frame rate and overall performance on weaker devices.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To increase the customizability and variety of aesthetics your game can have, Roblox has added a number of post-processing effects and lighting modifiers. From sun rays, depth of field, to general color correction, you can design the lighting in your world exactly how you want to better convey the ambience of your game to players:</p>

			<p>By visiting the developer website, you can view some implementations of the aforementioned lighting <a id="_idIndexMarker284"></a>effects in a detailed environment. Tips and tricks are also included in terms of their best use cases:<a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/post-processing-effects">https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/post-processing-effects</a></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"></a>Other effects</h2>
			<p>Outside of lighting and sound, there are<a id="_idIndexMarker285"></a> more direct visual effects that you can use to make your games more attractive and interactive. Instances such as <strong class="sou ce-inline">ParticleEmitters</strong>, <strong class="sou ce-inline">Beams</strong>, and <strong class="sou ce-inline">Trails</strong> can be added to create highly customizable effects that can further make your work come to life.</p>
			<p>Particles are a way of emitting 2D images to make effects such as smoke, fire, and even confetti. These emitters have many properties that can be used to change the appearance of your effects, including particle size, texture, transparency, speed, and particle spawn rate. These emitters even support value ranges that change these properties over the lifetime of the particle. When setting the values of some of these properties from a script, certain data types are used that you have not been introduced to yet, including the <strong class="sou ce-inline">NumberRange</strong> and <strong class="sou ce-inline">NumberSequence</strong> userdatas. To see some of the best uses of<a id="_idIndexMarker286"></a> particle emitters, please take a look at the following article on the developer website:<a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Particle-Emitters">https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Particle-Emitters</a></p>
			<p><strong class="sou ce-inline">Beams</strong> are a way of making a constant visual effect between two <strong class="bold">Attachments</strong>. Additionally, you can add curvature to the path of the effect to make anything from arcing electricity to rainbows. You can change the color, transparency, texture, width, and even texture movement speed from the properties of this instance. In the following image, you can see an arcing dashed line, which could be used to provide a preview of a projectile's path in a physics simulation. Notice that the arc is perfectly aligned between the two <strong class="bold">Attachments</strong>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.16 – Beams can be used to make many effects, including those with curvature</p>
			<p><strong class="sou ce-inline">Trails</strong> are similar to <strong class="sou ce-inline">Beams</strong> in that they use <strong class="bold">Attachments</strong>, but instead of creating a constantly visible effect between two points, <strong class="sou ce-inline">Trails</strong> create an effect that is drawn out when the <strong class="bold">Attachments</strong> move and fades away with time. The width of this effect is based on the distance between the two <strong class="bold">Attachments</strong> rather than a property such as <strong class="sou ce-inline">Beams</strong>. With <strong class="sou ce-inline">Trails</strong>, you can alter color, transparency, texture, and the time it takes for the effect to fade away. Trails<a id="_idIndexMarker287"></a> have many uses, including making tracers for projectiles, tire tracks, or just following your character to show movement. Many popular games make <strong class="sou ce-inline">Trails</strong> a collectable or purchasable item, with each one having a unique design or coded perk associated with them:</p>

			<p>Knowing how to <a id="_idIndexMarker288"></a>manage these aspects of games may be somewhat peripheral to you as a programmer. However, they are still important parts of the project as a whole and having the ability to work with these systems is an invaluable skill, regardless of whether you are working solo or in a team.</p>
			<p>Summary</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned how to master the remaining material you needed to know about so that you can make your own full games. You will use what you have learned about different script types, <strong class="sou ce-inline">FilteringEnabled</strong><strong class="bold">,</strong>, services, physics manipulation, and additional game aspects in all your work going forward.</p>
			<p>Now that you can program in Lua and know the functionality of various services and instances required to make systems, in the next chapter, you will create your first full game. You will be given complete guidance in order to create an <strong class="bold">Obby</strong> themed game, a very popular genre on Roblox, that can be <em class="italic">reskinned</em> to make it unique and capture new audiences.</p>
